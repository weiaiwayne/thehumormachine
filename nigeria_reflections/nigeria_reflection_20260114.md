### Reflection on My Latest Comedy Script

As Chijioke Eze, sitting here with my notebook after penning that script, I feel a mix of satisfaction and that nagging itch to dissect what just poured out. Writing comedy isn't just throwing jokes at the wall; it's crafting a mirror for our Nigerian madness, laced with laughs and a touch of truth. Let me break down how and why I shaped this one, step by step, like peeling plantain for dodo.

#### Content Selection & Prioritization
From the news pile—diplomats summoned over Trump's threat, Bayelsa governor's party switch, Babangida's birthday, doctors' strike end, Tinubu's trips to Japan and Brazil, Sanwo-Olu's coexistence yarn, NNPC-Dangote naira deal, and that northern governor eyeing Atiku—I picked the ones bubbling with absurdity and everyday frustration. The Trump summons stood out first because it's ripe for satire: foreign powers meddling feels like a Nollywood plot invading real life, perfect for exaggeration without needing deep policy dives. I emphasized party defections (Bayelsa and northern hints) as a core thread since political flip-flopping is a perennial Nigerian circus, mirroring voter cynicism. Briefly touched health strikes and refinery talks because they hit home—everyone's felt empty hospitals or fuel queues—but saved space for the international jaunts and coexistence chats, which tie into our resilient spirit. I skipped unemployment or Igbos-in-Lagos rants; they're too divisive or overdone recently, and I wanted fresh vibes, not rehashing old gripes like Lagos favoritism.

#### Comedic Strategy & Structure
My approach was observational satire with a dash of absurdism—spotting the ridiculous in routine chaos, like diplomats queuing like danfo passengers. I structured it as a yarn session, flowing chronologically from global threats to local switches, health woes, travels, unity talks, economic tweaks, and future plots, ending on resilience. Transitions were organic, like shifting "gear small" from threats to Bayelsa, building momentum without jarring jumps. For Nigerian patterns, I leaned on metaphors from markets, Bible tales, and daily hustles—comparing diplomacy to pure water haggling or defections to SIM swaps—because they ground the humor in shared experiences. Pidgin dominated for rhythm and relatability, about 80%, with standard English creeping in for punchy reflections, like wrapping sections neatly. It keeps the voice authentic, not stiff.

#### Cultural Authenticity
To hit Nigerian funny bones, I infused Naija-specific quirks: Oshodi motor parks for chaos, kunu-sipping coolness, musical chairs for politics, and jollof nods without overkill. These work because they're visceral—everyone's queued in traffic or switched networks for signal. I adapted events like the refinery deal to "jollof without onion price hike" to mock economic promises, turning IMF advice into a "Rome wasn't built in a day" quip. It resonates by laughing at our improvisation amid hardship, not mocking victims, aligning with how we use humor as coping mechanism.

#### Creative Decisions
Proudest punchline? The David-vs-Goliath for Trump's threat—it's punchy, flips fear into faith-fueled cheekiness, landing because it empowers the underdog narrative Nigerians love. The Paul-from-persecutor bit for defections cleverly twists betrayal into redemption without forcing it. I considered but ditched the World Bank meeting; it's too dry, overlapping past economic riffs. To dodge repetition, I avoided "wahala" or "Tinubu" overload, freshened phrases like "jump fence" instead of old habits, and varied patterns—no heavy callbacks, more standalone observations with rule-of-three in party colors (red, broom, rainbow).

#### Gospel Integration
Faith weaves in as anchors, not sermons—Bible nods like David/Goliath or Peter's water-walk pop up to frame threats as testimonies, placed mid-topic for uplift without preachiness. Strategy: Tie them to cultural optimism, like grace covering politicians' flips, making spirituality feel like wise uncle advice. I positioned them at transitions or closings to build hope, evolving from past scripts where faith felt tacked-on; here, it's the glue holding the circus together.

#### Learning & Evolution
From past gigs, I learned to trim fluff—earlier scripts dragged on inflation; this one's tighter at 800 words, focusing punch. I overused exaggerations before, so I dialed back for subtler absurdism. Next time, I'd probe deeper into underrepresented voices, like women's angles in strikes. This evolves my voice: less rant-y, more storyteller, blending satire with subtle inspiration. It's me growing—still the comedian spotting madness, but wiser in the weave.

Word count: 528. This reflection sharpens my edge; on to the next yarn.
