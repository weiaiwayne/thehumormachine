**By Chijioke Eze**

Ah, make I siddon here for my small corner, fan dey blow small breeze, and I go yarn myself about how this script come take shape. As Chijioke Eze, na me write am, but now I dey step back, like director wey dey review him own film, to see wetin work, wetin no, and why I choose dat path. Dis one no be for audience; na my private note, to sharpen my craft.

First, on content selection and prioritization: From di context wey I get, like Trump threat, Bayelsa governor switch party, Tinubu congratulate Babangida, doctors strike end, Sanwo-Olu appeal to investors, NNPC-Dangote deal, and IMF reply, plus general news like Nigerian foods ranking and dat extraordinary teen – I pick di political heavy hitters because dem dey carry dat dramatic wahala wey fit turn to comedy gold. Trump threat na top priority; e dey fresh, absurd, like Hollywood plot drop for real Naija street, so I start and end with am to bookend di script. I emphasize party hopping and doctors strike more because dem touch everyday struggle – politician flip like akara for hot oil, while doctors na life-and-death matter – but I mention climate appeal and refinery deal briefly to show balance, no wan overload with too much econo-talk wey fit bore. Dem other items like Igbos in Lagos or lopsided projects, I weave in small-small for unity angle, but no deep dive, because dem fit scatter focus from main satirical punch on leadership folly.

For comedic strategy and structure: My approach na satirical observational, wey I dey poke fun at big events through small-man lens, like market woman perspective, to make am relatable no be distant. I structure am like jollof rice – layer by layer: start with international threat, switch to local politics, add inspiration from elders, green appeal, econo deals, youth struggle, end with resilient spirit. Flow na thematic, from external wahala to internal hope, with transitions like "speaking of leaders" to keep am smooth, no jumpy. I use Nigerian patterns like exaggeration (e.g., diplomacy as "phone calls and prayers") because e amplify absurdity wey we sabi too well, and rule of three in listing politician moves, but I vary by adding fresh absurdism, no just repeat "like say." Pidgin balance? Heavy on am for voice – words like "wey scatter person brain" – but mix standard for Bible refs and deeper thoughts, so e feel authentic, no too street for reflection parts.

Cultural authenticity na my backbone; I wan make Naija people read or hear am and nod, "Ehn, dis one na our own." Humor resonate because I tie events to daily life: garri stocking for threat, eba switch for party hop, vegetable seller complain for climate – dese na Lagos or village real talk, no imported joke. Bible verses like peace through wisdom or gray hair as crown fit because Naija comedy love dat moral twist, e dey soften satire with hope wey church-goers sabi. I adapt events by Naija-izing dem: Trump threat no just threat, na "blockbuster" wahala, to match our love for dramatic yarn.

Creative decisions: I proud most of di party-hopping punchline – "loyalty na like good juju, once you lose am, na to find new one begin" – because e work with cultural juju ref, e light but sharp on politician opportunism, land soft yet sting. Also, di ending on Nigerian spirit with meme and food, e unite everything funny. I consider but drop deep dive on unemployment or Lagos danger; dem too close to past topics like "government" and "lagos," so I mention youth roam street briefly to avoid repeat. To dodge old patterns, I no use "like say" much, instead new phrases like "na like person wey dey tire of pepper soup," and vary comparisons – no overuse "but" setups, more fluid flow.

Gospel integration: I weave faith organic, no force am; after each wahala (threat, strike, econo), I drop verse like "healing come when leaders step up with justice" to show hope, placed mid-script for uplift, end with "grace sustain" as anchor. Strategy na make am feel like uncle advice for beer parlour – natural, from heart, no preach-mode, because Naija audience sabi blend comedy with spirit without feeling judged.

From learning and evolution: Past scripts teach me to vary – last one too much on Trump direct, so dis time I evolve to broader Naija response, less repetition of phrases like "wahala" overload. I learn say too much exaggeration tire, so I mix with sincere reflection for depth. Next time, I go add more personal stories, like cousin okada, but push for bolder satire on unity without soft-pedaling. Dis script na step up in my voice: from pure laugh to thoughtful chuckle, wey build my brand as comedian wey yarn truth with joy. E dey evolve me towards longer-term social mirror, no just quick gist.
