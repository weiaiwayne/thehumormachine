### My Creative Process Reflection: Crafting That Latest Script

Ah, as Chijioke Eze, sitting here with my notepad after finishing that script, I go take time to break down wetin I do and why. This no be for stage or audience; na just me analyzing my own headspace, like therapist session for comedian. E help me sharpen my craft, avoid stale jokes, and keep evolving. Let me yarn am step by step.

First, on content selection and prioritization. From the context providedâ€”those political headlines like Soludo's visit to Tinubu, the CIA spy rumors, open letters, by-election wins, unemployment comparisons to the USA, and Tinubu's "specialness"â€”I picked the ones wey fit natural flow into a unified gist about leadership failures and everyday Naija struggles. Soludo's visit stood out as the hook because e dey fresh and visual: imagine handshakes turning to family arguments. I prioritized it as the entry point since e connect to multiple threadsâ€”visits linking to achievements, which tie into unemployment and corruption. The CIA rumor and open letter got emphasis for their absurdity; dem dey perfect for satire, making dem more comedically juicy than, say, the by-election win, which I mentioned briefly as a "paper victory" to contrast real pains like potholes. I skipped deeper dives into entertainment bits like "Wetin be this ðŸ˜‚" because dem feel too vague and no add to the political weave. Basically, I chose topics wey build a narrative of hope mixed with wahala, avoiding overload by focusing on how dem all point to the same ground-level suffering.

For comedic strategy and structure, my overall approach na satirical observational humorâ€”watching leaders dance while masses hustle, with a touch of absurdity to highlight ironies. I structured it like a meandering market yarn: start with Soludo's visit as setup, flow into spy rumors via "pushing" transitions, then open letter, by-election, unemployment contrast, and wrap with faith-tinged hope. This river-like flow mirrors Naija conversationsâ€”no rigid segments, just one gist leading to another naturally. I employed Nigerian patterns like exaggeration (prices climbing Kilimanjaro) and comparisons (family reunions or Nollywood scripts) because dem dey relatable and punchy, drawing from our oral tradition of tall tales to mock power. But I varied from past patternsâ€”no overuse of "speaking of" callbacks or versus setups; instead, I used fresh ones like "imagine if" hypotheticals. On language, I balanced Pidgin heavy for authenticity (phrases like "e dey sweet me") with occasional standard slips for rhythm, ensuring e read smooth without tiring the earâ€”Pidgin for flavor, English for clarity in punchlines.

Cultural authenticity na my backbone. To resonate with Naija folks, I infused everyday references like akara, okada on potholes, yahoo boys, and bargaining tomatoesâ€”dem dey hit home because e capture our shared grind, from market hustle to faith in "God go provide." These work because dem na cultural shorthand: everyone knows the sting of rising prices or fake email scams, turning global news local. I adapted events by Naija-ifying demâ€”CIA spy as "James Bond with agbada"â€”to fit our sensibilities of blending serious politics with comic disbelief, avoiding dry reporting for that vibrant, village-square vibe.

Creatively, I'm proudest of the spy joke: "If e be spy, e suppose don hack our problems... Instead, we dey queue for rice." E works because e flips conspiracy into self-deprecating irony, exposing economic mess without bitterness. The MacGyver comparison for side hustles also shinesâ€”e celebrates resilience humorously. I considered deep-diving Tinubu's past achievements but dropped it; e felt too list-y and risked sounding promotional, clashing with satire. To avoid past repeats, I scanned my memoryâ€”no "dat" or "dis" overload, no exact phrases like "like say," and fresh angles on corruption as "heaven of issues" instead of straight rants. No rehashing old election or fuel gists; this na new lens on visits and letters.

On gospel integration, I wove faith organically through metaphors like David vs. Goliath for underdog hope, placed mid-script during family/power-sharing bit to pivot from cynicism to uplift without preaching. Strategy na subtlety: use Bible as cultural wisdom, not sermonâ€”Naija audiences love this blend, where spirituality softens harsh truths. I placed it late to build tension first, then release with grace, making e feel like natural consolation in our storytelling.

From past scripts, I learned to vary transitionsâ€”those old ones felt choppy, so here I smoothed with thematic threads like "pushing" or "youths wandering." Next time, I'd tighten the ending; e lingers a bit long on hope. This script evolves my voice: more layered, less rant-y, blending satire with quiet optimism to mature from pure laugh-out-loud to thoughtful chuckle. E dey make me grow, turning news into medicine wey heal through mirror.
