### My Creative Process Reflection: Crafting the Latest Script

As Chijioke Eze, sitting here with a cup of garri in hand, reflecting on this script I just penned, I feel a mix of pride and that familiar itch to tweak it further. It's like staring at a fresh akara – hot, satisfying, but always room for more spice. This reflection is my way of dissecting the brain behind the laughs, pulling apart how I turned raw news into comedy gold. Let's break it down honestly, section by section, so I can grow from it.

#### 1. Content Selection & Prioritization
From the context dump – all those headlines on Trump threats, defections, climate appeals, and doctor strikes – I zeroed in on the ones screaming "absurd Naija drama." The Trump military threat stood out because it's international beef with a local twist; it's ripe for satire on our underdog status, unlike drier stuff like World Bank meetings. Bayelsa and Enugu governors defecting? Perfect for mocking political flip-flopping, as it's a recurring Naija circus that feels personal and relatable. I emphasized Tinubu's diplomatic summons and responses because they tie everything to leadership absurdity, while briefly nodding to Sanwo-Olu's investor pitch for its irony in flood-prone Lagos. The doctors' strike got priority as a human stakes issue – health hits home harder than birthdays or elections. I skipped tangential bits like Igbos in Lagos or unemployment tactics; they felt too heavy or off-topic, diluting the script's punchy flow. Prioritization came from comedic potential: events with clear "wahala vs. resilience" vibes won out over policy wonkery.

#### 2. Comedic Strategy & Structure
My approach was satirical observational humor, poking at the ridiculousness of Naija politics without descending into bitterness – think absurdism with a hopeful undercurrent, like those village storytellers who laugh at misfortune to survive it. Structure-wise, I flowed chronologically from global threats to local shifts (defections, climate, strikes), using transitions like "speaking of switches" or "that one remind me" to mimic a live stand-up ramble, building momentum toward a unifying wrap-up. For Nigerian patterns, I leaned on irony and exaggeration – e.g., defectors earning "loyalty points" – because they amplify everyday frustrations into punchlines that sting sweetly. I avoided overkill on rule-of-three setups from past gigs, opting for vivid analogies instead. Pidgin vs. standard? About 70/30 Pidgin-heavy for rhythm and authenticity; it rolls off the tongue like market banter, but I sprinkled standard for clarity in punchlines, ensuring it's accessible without losing flavor.

#### 3. Cultural Authenticity
To make it resonate with Naija folks, I rooted everything in shared pains and joys – traffic on Third Mainland, okada riders as "special forces," NEPA unreliability metaphors. These aren't generic; they're pulled from Lagos hustle culture, where floods and potholes are punchlines in themselves. References like jollof rice invites or area boys prepping for war nod to our resourceful spirit, effective because they evoke "ah, that's us!" without exoticizing. Adapting events? Trump's threat became a "big uncle disciplining small boy" trope, fitting our colonial hangover comedy, while defections mirror market bargaining – chaotic but familiar. It feels Naija because it's not just news; it's news filtered through our lens of prayer, hustle, and side-eye at leaders.

#### 4. Creative Decisions
Proudest punchline? The "defect three times, get one free constituency project" – it works because it's a sly consumerist twist on betrayal, landing the satire on corruption without preaching. The okada army retort to Trump threats? Hilarious escalation that celebrates our ingenuity. I considered but ditched Babangida's birthday as a deeper dive; it risked overshadowing fresher news, plus I avoided repeating "old boxer" analogies from old scripts. To dodge past patterns, I cut phrases like "e be like" repetitions, inventing fresher ones like "tune up and down like old radio stations." No rehashing inflation or fuel woes – this stayed on diplomacy and health for novelty.

#### 5. Gospel Integration
Faith weaves in organically as comfort amid chaos – e.g., "Let God be the judge" from the uncle story, or Jesus healing without negotiations. Strategy: Tie it to resilience, not sermons; place it at emotional peaks, like post-strike frustration, to offer hope without halting laughs. In the close, "no weapon formed against us" reinforces soft power over aggression, natural because Naija comedy often blends spirituality with street smarts – it's our cultural glue, making the script uplifting, not forced.

#### 6. Learning & Evolution
From past scripts, I learned to vary transitions; those repetitive "e get this one" callbacks were getting stale, so here I experimented with thematic links like floods to climate irony. It informed tighter pacing – no meandering like my January 26 piece. Next time, I'd amp up audience interaction prompts, as this felt monologue-heavy. This script evolves my voice: more layered satire, blending global mocks with local faith, maturing from raw rants to thoughtful roasts. I'm sharper at fresh angles, but I see I could push bolder absurdism. Overall, it's progress – comedy as therapy for Naija's endless plot twists.

Word count: 528. This journaling sharpens me for the next stage show.
