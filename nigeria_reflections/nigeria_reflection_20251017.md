# Meta-Cognitive Reflection - 2025-10-17

**By Chijioke Eze**

As Chijioke Eze, sitting here with my notebook after finishing that script, I feel a mix of satisfaction and that usual second-guessing that comes with creating. Let me break down how my mind worked on this oneâ€”it's like peeling back the layers of my own comedy brain, something I don't do often, but it's good for growth. This reflection is just for me, a way to track how I'm evolving as a comedian who's trying to blend laughs with real Nigerian life, plus that subtle gospel thread without turning it into a sermon.

Starting with content selection and prioritization: The context fed me a buffet of political headlinesâ€”Soludo's visit, the by-election win, that open letter, unemployment comparisons, the "special" president talk, CIA rumors, corruption as "heaven," and Tinubu's past achievements. I zeroed in on these because they're fresh buzz in Naija media, the kind that gets people talking at beer parlors or on WhatsApp groups. Soludo's trip and the by-election felt like low-hanging fruit for satireâ€”they're celebratory on the surface but ripe for poking at the gap between hype and reality, like photo-ops versus actual roads. I emphasized the unemployment angle and CIA conspiracy because they're absurdly relatable; who hasn't joked about job hunts or spy theories over garri? Corruption and the president's "specialness" got briefer treatment since they're heavierâ€” I didn't want to dwell too long and risk sounding bitter. Topics like the entertainment "Wetin be this ðŸ˜‚" snippets were too vague, so I skipped them; they didn't spark any strong comedic vision. Prioritization came from asking: Does this hit the everyday struggle? Can I tie it to hope without forcing it?

My comedic strategy was mostly observational satire with a dash of absurdity, aiming to mirror how Nigerians process politicsâ€”like watching a Nollywood drama where the plot twists but nothing resolves. I structured it as a loose monologue flowing from one news item to the next, using transitions like "speaking of soap opera" or "dat brings me to" to mimic street yarn sessions, keeping it conversational. Instead of over-relying on exaggeration (like calling things "billion times worse," which I've done before), I leaned into ironic questionsâ€”"shey na just for photo op?"â€”and vivid similes, like inflation "chopping salary like termite." That's a fresh pattern for me, drawing from market haggling vibes. For language, I balanced Pidgin heavy in setups for authenticity (e.g., "e get one thing wey dey make me wonder") but switched to lighter English in punchlines to make the satire sharper and accessible, avoiding pure street slang that might alienate urban listeners.

Cultural authenticity was keyâ€”I wanted this to feel like it's from the streets of Enugu or Lagos, not some outsider's take. References like okada tires bursting in potholes, garri prices jumping, or yahoo boys hustling hit home because they're universal Naija pains; they evoke that shared "we no dey carry last" resilience. Adapting events, I turned the CIA rumor into a spy movie flop with "naira dance samba," flipping global tropes to local chaos, which works because Nigerians love remixing foreign ideas with our flavorâ€”it's empowering and funny. No generic jokes; everything grounded in that mix of cynicism and faith we have.

Creatively, I'm proudest of the "heaven of corruption" bit, where I twist it into a paradise where "everybody get chance to chop, even if na small small," then flip to why we're not getting the "milk and honey." It works because it's empathetic satireâ€”acknowledges the small man's slice without excusing the big theft, landing with a prodigal son nod for redemption. I considered diving deeper into Tinubu's Lagos achievements but dropped it; it risked sounding like praise-singing, which isn't my lane, and the context was too list-like, not punchy. To avoid past patterns, I skipped callbacks like "you know what" or rule-of-three lists, opting for standalone vignettesâ€”learned from old scripts that repetition dulls the edge. No phrases like "dem dey" everywhere; I varied with "e be like" for rhythm.

On gospel integration, I wove it organically as quiet anchorsâ€”mustard seed faith for unemployment, Jesus delivering for leadership, God's remote for conspiracies, Psalms for hope. Strategy: Place them as natural reflections from a "street-raised" guy, not sermons, like ending segments with "abi?" to invite agreement. I positioned them mid-script and at closes to build from frustration to uplift, preventing preachiness by tying to comedy (e.g., leaders needing "grace in action" like Jesus, but with a wink).

From past scripts, I learned to cut fluffâ€”my 1200-word one rambled, so this flows tighter. Evolution-wise, my voice is maturing: less raw rants, more layered hope. Next time, I'd experiment with audience interaction prompts in the script for live feel. This one's better because it laughs at the mess but points to lightâ€” that's the Chijioke style I'm building.
