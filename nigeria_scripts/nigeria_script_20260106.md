Eh, my brothers and sisters, imagine the wahala wey dey brew from that side of the Atlantic, where this big man Donald Trump dey talk say him go send soldiers come scatter our peace here. Chai, the man wake up one morning, feel like playing soldier boy, and next thing, our own president dey summon diplomats like say na village meeting for the square. You know that kind feeling when uncle from abroad dey threaten family gathering, and the head of house dey call everybody to table? Exactly so, but instead of jollof rice, dem dey discuss tanks and jets. And President Tinubu, God bless am, respond say dem dey handle am diplomatically, like say na small talk over garri and soup. Shey you see the comedy? One side dey load missiles, the other dey say make we pray and negotiate. Me, I dey think, if Trump hear say our diplomats carry Bible and prayer points go embassy, him go even laugh and cancel the whole plan. Because e get how prayer don scatter bigger threats before, abi? Even when the world dey shake, grace dey hold everything steady.

Now, speaking from that diplomatic drama to our own backyard politics, see this Bayelsa matter wey dey make noise. The governor there, one time dey rock PDP colors like loyal fan, next minute, him don switch to APC like say na new jersey for football match. E be like say party loyalty na like old shirt wey tear, you just find better one to wear. And everybody dey hail am, like say na smart move in chess game. But wait, if politicians fit jump ship like that, why we no go do the same for our daily hustles? Imagine you dey work for one company, salary dey delay, you just pack bag go next door office with better pay. No wahala, life must move. Only say for them, when dem jump, dem land with convoy and security. For us, na danfo bus and prayers. E sweet me to see how dem dey play this game, but e remind me say, in the end, only one King no dey switch sides – the one wey promise eternal loyalty no matter the storm. Politicians fit change color like chameleon, but faith no dey fluctuate like that.

That switch dey mind me of another angle, this Anambra election wey dey hot everywhere. Lagos APC people dey praise Tinubu say him stay neutral, like referee wey no blow foul for any side. Neutral, eh? In this our politics wey full of drama, neutrality be like trying to sit on fence during heavy rain – you go still wet. Dem hail am say e no take side, but deep down, everybody know say neutrality na just code for waiting to see who win before you congratulate. And the man do am well, no noise, no bias, just quiet watching. Me, I respect that small, because e show say experience teach person to pick battles wisely. But imagine if we apply that for everyday life – your neighbor dey fight, you just stand neutral, no pick side, until the winner buy you beer. Life go easy small. Yet, in all this political fencing, e good to remember say true peace no come from man-made neutrality, but from the Prince of Peace wey no need to watch and wait before acting. Him already call us to higher ground, far from the mudslinging.

Oya, let us shift gear to this doctors' strike wey dey give everybody headache. The government dey move to end am, like say na simple on and off switch. But you know how these things dey go – one side dey demand better pay, the other dey promise heaven on earth, and patients dey suffer in between. I remember one time, my cousin dey hospital, doctor strike start, next thing nurses dey run the show with paracetamol for everything. From malaria to broken leg, na one solution. And the wahala? People dey queue like say na bank alert day, praying say their matter no too serious. Government say dem go fix am, but how? With more talks or real action? E be like our leaders dey treat health like side chick – promise plenty, deliver small. But even in that confusion, e comforting say there's a Healer wey no dey strike, no dey join union, just dey work 24/7 without holiday. When human hands fail, divine touch no dey miss. So, doctors, government, make una quick settle, because some of us no fit wait for miracle every time we cough.

And talking about leaders and their moves, see this Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State head, wey dey appeal to global investors over climate change at that international something. Him stand there, talk say make foreign money come pour in for green projects, while back home, people dey battle flood every rainy season. E be like say you dey invite guests to party, but your house roof dey leak. Investors go hear am, think say na serious business, but we know the real score – potholes wey swallow cars, waste wey block drain, and heat wey dey cook person alive. Yet, him dey paint picture of bright future, full of solar panels and clean air. Admirable, sha, because e show say hope no dey die easy. But me, I dey wonder, if climate change na the big enemy, why no start with fixing the basics, like roads wey no turn to river during downpour? Global people go invest, yes, but until then, we dey manage with umbrella and faith. And faith, e strong pass any climate summit, because when storms come, e no run – e stands firm, shielding us through.

This Babangida matter sweet me too, former military head turning 84, and Tinubu send congratulations like old friend. At 84, the man still dey relevant, like fine wine wey age better. Politicians dey hail am, remember the days of iron fist and decrees, but now na gentle birthday vibes. E make me think say, in this our hustle, if you survive politics, you fit survive anything. Babangida don see coups, elections, everything, and still dey here, smiling. What be the secret? Maybe na quiet wisdom or just stubborn grace. For us ordinary folks, turning 84 mean grandkids plenty, stories for moonlight, and prayers every dawn. No military parade, just family and God. So, happy birthday to am, and lesson for all – no matter the power you wield, time go humble everybody. But the eternal One, Him age no dey count, and Him celebrations no end at 84.

Now, weave all these together, and you see the pattern in our story – threats from afar, switches at home, appeals to the world, strikes in hospitals, birthdays that endure. E full of twists, like Nollywood plot wey no dey finish. But through the madness, one thing steady: the hope wey come from above, turning wahala to testimony. Politicians fit promise, but only the divine vow no break. So, as we laugh at these scenes, make we hold that grace tight, because in the end, e go carry us pass any threat or switch. And if Trump or anybody try nonsense, just whisper a prayer – na the ultimate diplomatic tool. Peace out, my people, stay blessed.
