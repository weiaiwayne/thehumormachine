Oya, good evening, my people! How una dey? Hope NEPA no do anyhow today? Me, I nearly scatter my gen set yesterday after dem bring light for only five minutes. Five minutes! Na to boil egg abi wetin?

So, I dey scroll through Reddit, Nairaland, everywhere today, trying to understand this our Nigeria. You know, like say I be oyinbo researcher writing book. And ehn, the thing wey I see… ha!

First of all, Reddit people dey vex about descriptive post titles. Descriptive ke? In Nigeria? Bros, if I wan describe my suffering under this government, I go need whole encyclopedia! We need entire libraries, not just descriptive post titles! Make dem face the real problems, abeg.

Then I see one question, "Why are Kenyans protesting while Nigerians aren't?" Ah, my brother, that one touch me! See, Kenyans, dem get energy. Dem dey vex, dem dey show am. We Nigerians, we don tire. We dey protest inside our hearts. Na so we take survive. We dey protest by migrating to Canada and Japa-ing all over the world. It's a silent protest, you understand? Economic protest.

Speaking of surviving, una see this our President, Tinubu? Baba dey try, I won't lie. But e be like say the trying too dey costly. Fuel price still dey dance salsa. Dollar dey do breakdance. My wallet dey do acrobatics trying to keep up!

And Ganduje… Ganduje still dey relevant? Ah, Nigeria, I hail thee! Oga Ganduje, the man of many caps and even more controversial legacies, still dey hold office. Only in Nigeria. Wait, what? Did I just say Ganduje "still dey hold office"? My bad, I think I mixed up the past, present, and future tenses again because it is still all the same. I am still expecting to wake up tomorrow, and he will be the President. I am still expecting to wake up tomorrow, and nothing will change.

Remember that time I go buy gala for traffic, and the boy say e no get change? I give am N500, e say e go bring change. I wait, I wait, I wait… Traffic don clear, I don dey drive away. Bros, the boy start to shout, "Oga, your change! Oga, your change!" I stop, collect my change, na N300. N200 for gala! Na diamond them put inside? Na the same thing this government dey do. Dem promise us change, but the change dem bring dey cost us our whole salary!

And Nairaland jokes section… dem dey try. But honestly, sometimes I read am, I no understand wetin dem dey laugh about. E be like say dem dey laugh to forget the suffering. Or maybe dem dey laugh because dem don give up completely. I can’t tell

But seriously, my people, we need to find joy somehow. We need to laugh, even when NEPA take light for the tenth time today. We need to laugh, even when dollar reach N2000. We need to laugh, because if we no laugh, we go cry. And crying no go solve anything. E go just dehydrate us for this hot weather.

So let's laugh today, my people. Let's laugh so hard that our leaders will hear us and say, "Ah, these Nigerians, dem dey mad! Maybe we need to do something before dem vex finish." And maybe, just maybe, dem go do something. But till then, I dey my house dey hustle, dey laugh small, dey cry small, dey pray to God, and dey hope say tomorrow go better. And if tomorrow no better, ehn, we go still dey here. We go still dey laugh. Because we be Nigerians, and we too stubborn to give up! Oya, who wan buy drink? My money dey… well, my money dey try to dey.
