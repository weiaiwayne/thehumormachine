My people, imagine this: one fine morning, you wake up to hear say American President Trump don threaten to send soldiers come Naija because of some border wahala or whatever excuse dem get. And immediately, our own President Tinubu summons every single foreign diplomat inside Abuja like say na emergency family meeting. You know how e be, when big brother abroad talk nonsense, we here gather to clap hands and sing kumbaya. But seriously, which kain diplomacy be this one? Dem dey talk as if Nigeria na small boy wey need big uncle to discipline. And Tinubu, God bless am, respond say him government dey engage quietly. Engage how? With prayer points or with jollof rice invitation? Because if na military threat, e better make we start to prepare our area boys as special forces. E get this one uncle for my village wey whenever neighbor threaten am, him go just smile and say, "Let God be the judge." But una know say for politics, God sometimes dey take leave, abi?

Now, speaking of switches wey dey happen faster than NEPA light, check out this Bayelsa Governor wey just dump PDP join APC. E be like say political parties na like those old radio stations wey you dey tune up and down looking for clear signal. One day you dey opposition, next day you dey ruling party, all because e get better jingles or more advert money. And no be only Bayelsa o, even Enugu Governor don run go meet Tinubu after him own defection. Dem dey defect like say na Black Friday sale for loyalty. Me, I dey think say soon dem go introduce loyalty points: defect three times, get one free constituency project. But the real comedy na how everybody hail am as strategic move. Strategic? If na strategy, why dem no teach am for school? Because if politicians be chess masters, we citizens na just pawns wey dem dey sacrifice every two years. And in the middle of all this musical chairs, Tinubu still find time congratulate former military President Babangida on him 84th birthday. 84 years, my brother, and him still dey watch from the sidelines as if say him dey wait for rematch. E be like those old boxers wey retire but come back for exhibition fight. Happy birthday, IBB, may your years continue to multiply like unchecked potholes on Lagos roads.

That one remind me of our Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Just last Thursday, him make renewed appeal to global investors at some international climate change something. Climate change? In Lagos where rain dey fall and flood swallow danfo buses like say na biblical flood? Him dey beg investors come pour money into green projects, but una see the irony? We get state wey dem call most dangerous for Naija, with traffic wey fit make saint curse, and him dey talk climate. I imagine those foreign investors listening, thinking, "Okay, we go invest, but first, how una go fix this go-slow wey dey turn Third Mainland Bridge into parking lot?" Sanwo-Olu, my governor, you dey try, but sometimes e be like say una dey sell Lagos as paradise while we inside na everyday survival. And the beauty? Even with all this, Nigerians still dey manage. We go buy umbrella from roadside seller, dodge pothole like pro gamer, and continue to hustle. It's that resilience wey make us special, like say God design us with extra grace for tough times.

But let's shift to something wey dey touch all of us directly: this resident doctors strike wey government dey move to end. Doctors, our heroes wey suppose dey save lives, now dey sit-down because salary no gree pay bills. Government say dem dey negotiate, but negotiation for Naija na like bargaining for Oshodi market – plenty talk, small result. Imagine, you dey hospital bed, nurse come tell you say doctor no dey because him join protest. You go pray say na small illness, because if na serious one, e be like say you don enter waiting room for heaven gate. And Tinubu government, with all the diplomatic summons and party defections, now focus on doctors. E good sha, because health na wealth, but why e always take strike to shake table? Me, I dey think say politicians get private doctors wey no dey strike, so dem no feel the pain like we. But here's the hope: even in this chaos, we remember say healing come from above. Like that Bible story where Jesus heal the sick without CV or salary negotiation. If only our leaders go tap into that kind power, maybe doctors go resume and hospitals go turn to miracle centers.

Now, tie all this together, you go see say Naija politics na like Nollywood series wey plot twist every episode. From Trump threat wey make us summon ambassadors like wedding guests, to governors jumping parties like kids playing hopscotch, to Sanwo-Olu selling climate dreams in a flooded city, and doctors reminding us say body no be firewood. E be absurd, e be frustrating, but e be our story. And in the midst of it, we laugh, we pray, we push forward. Because if we no laugh, the wahala go swallow us. But seriously, if Trump really send soldiers, make dem know say Naija get own army of okada riders wey fit maneuver any terrain. And for the doctors, God go touch hearts, make peace reign so we all fit live to see better days. As for the defectors, una welcome to APC, but remember, loyalty na like generator fuel – e no dey last if you no maintain am.

One more thing before I round off this thought: this whole Trump matter, with Tinubu assuring diplomatic engagement, e make me wonder about international relations. Like, why Trump go even think of military action against Naija? Maybe him hear say we get too much talent exporting abroad, from musicians to footballers, and him fear competition. Or perhaps na because of our oil, but wait, we sef no dey enjoy am well. Either way, our leaders dey handle am maturely, no panic. But if e reach that point, I trust say Nigeria go respond with soft power – send am Afrobeat playlist or jollof challenge. No need for guns when culture fit conquer. And tying back to faith, remember say no weapon formed against us shall prosper, as the Good Book say. So even if threats fly, we stand firm, with prayer and pidgin power.

Finally, my brothers and sisters, in this 2026 wey don start with plenty drama, let's keep the humor alive. Because if politics no kill laugh, nothing go. And who knows, maybe next week another governor go defect back to PDP, completing the circle. But until then, stay blessed, stay sharp, and remember: in Naija, every day na potential punchline waiting to happen. Peace out.
