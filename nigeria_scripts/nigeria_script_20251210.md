Eh, make I yarn una this matter wey dey scatter my head like bad hair day for salon. You see this whole drama with that Yankee big shot talking about sending troops our side, as if say we be some backyard wey need cleaning? I mean, e be like say the man dey watch too much Nollywood action flick and think say Naija na set for one. But our side, dem dey summon ambassadors left and right, dey do that diplomatic jive, assuring everybody say e go calm down. Calm down ke? With economy wey dey bite harder than market woman bargaining for fish? Shey you no see say even when thunder dey roar outside, we still dey manage with umbrella from church crusade? 

Now, picture this: one state chief executive from that oil-rich place, the one wey suppose stick to him original party like glue on wrapper, suddenly switch allegiance to the other camp. Jump fence like say na intercontinental cup final. I tell you, politics for here na like choosing juju for protection – today you trust one, tomorrow you switch because the other one promise more power. And the cheering section from the capital's ruling crew, dem dey hail the neutrality in another state's vote, like say e be miracle wey Moses part Red Sea. Neutrality? Abeg, e be like referee wey dey blow whistle for both teams but pocket bribe from one. But let's face it, in this our hustle, switching sides na survival tactic, ehn? Like when you dey queue for ATM and the line too long, you go find shortcut through the bush.

That one time I hear say the head honcho dey send birthday cheers to that retired brass hat who clocked 84. IBB, the gap-toothed legend, turning another year with stories wey fit fill library. Congrats flying from high places, but me I dey think: at 84, wetin you wan do with more years? Rest? Or plan comeback like wrestler from 80s? E remind me of those uncles for village wey dey gather under mango tree, sharing war tales and how life suppose better. But truth be say, age bring wisdom, and maybe that's the real gift – knowing when to bow out gracefully, not like some wey dey cling to chair like it be life jacket in ocean.

Speaking of chairs and sitting pretty, this appeal from the megacity's top dog to foreign money bags, talking climate change and investment at some fancy event. Renewed plea, like pastor calling for second offering after first one no reach target. Global investors, come o, pour your dollars into our pot, we go fix the flood, the heat, everything. But e be like say dem dey forget say here, rain fall and road turn river, yet we still dey wade through with rubber slippers. Shey dem think say oyinbo man go hear "climate change" and rush come build factory? Nah, dem go calculate risk first – traffic jam wey swallow hours, bribe wey follow every permit, and youth wey dey jobless like sand for beach. Unemployment na that silent thief wey steal dreams, leaving families to pray extra rosary or shout hallelujah louder for breakthrough.

And ehn, this talk of ending the white coat people's strike? Doctors wey dey hold placards, demanding wetin suppose be theirs, while patients dey suffer in queue like market day. The powers that be dey move to patch things up, but how many times we hear "soon" turn to "later"? E be like promising child marriage of rice and stew, but the pot empty when hunger knock. In Naija, health care na lottery – you fit win bed in teaching hospital or lose everything to quack for backstreet. But even in that mess, we dey find grace, abi? Like how Bible talk say physician heal thyself, but here na we go beg God make the healer show up first.

Now, let me twist this to something we all feel deep: that coexistence challenge wey the megacity boss mention. Challenged how? Like trying to fit elephant, lion, and peacock in one danfo without fight. One side dey cry marginalization, saying projects favor one corner over others, as if the whole country na private estate. Igbos for the commercial hub feeling like guests in own home, and the mirage of unity dey fade faster than ice block under sun. E be like family reunion wey start with dance but end in argument over who eat last meat. But you know, in all this, we still dey manage – market women from east selling to west buyers, traders mixing yoruba, igbo, hausa in one shout. That's the real Naija spirit, resilient like palm wine tree wey bend but no break.

E remind me of those Reddit brothers wey dey yarn online, laughing at the absurdity. One guy say, "This threat from across water na joke, but if soldiers land, dem go learn say our jollof na weapon of mass distraction." Another one: "Switching parties? Na like changing church because pastor promise better miracle next Sunday." And that one on doctors: "Strike again? Make dem strike gold first, then we go talk pay." See, una dey capture the pain with punch, turning frustration to fuel for memes. E show say we no dull, even when bill come and pocket empty, we find way to chuckle.

But here's the deeper cut: all this noise, from threats to switches to appeals, na symptom of bigger ache – that condition wey make youth roam streets with CV in hand, dreaming of escape to lands wey promise steady light. The drummer's confession wey I read, talking rhythm of life here, beat of struggle mixed with joy. E be like our national anthem, but with offbeat for the hardship parts. And the talk of lopsided favors, asking if the leader na for one city or the federation? Fair question, shey? Like sharing akara, you no go give one child all, leave others with crumbs.

Yet, in the midst of this, I dey see that thread of hope, like sunlight piercing harmattan dust. Even when plans delay and promises scatter, there's that quiet faith wey say redemption dey come. Not from big men in suits, but from above, where grace no dey ration by tribe or zone. Politicians go vow paradise on earth, but only the carpenter from Nazareth deliver eternal upgrade. So we laugh, we yarn, we pray – because tomorrow, who knows? Maybe the next appeal land investor wey build road without pothole, or the strike end with raise wey make doctor smile. Or at least, we go continue dey gist like this, turning wahala to wisdom.

And speaking of wisdom, that departure for far east and south america – jetting off Thursday, probably to charm more funds or sign deals wey suppose trickle down. But trickle to who? The elite or the masses wey dey hawk pure water for junction? E be like rain wey fall on roof but no enter pot below. Still, we dey watch, we dey hope, because in Naija, miracle no dey announce, e just happen – like finding n500 note in old jeans pocket after thinking broke finish.

One more angle: this naira deal extension with the refinery giant and oil company, talking local currency for supply. Sounds smart, like cutting middleman to save cost, but e go work? With exchange rate dancing samba, shey e no be another promise wey go fade? Everyday Naija man dey calculate how to stretch salary, so if this bring cheaper product, hallelujah. If not, na back to black market hustle.

Eh, my people, in all this political circus, we dey learn say life na marathon, not sprint. We run, we stumble, we rise with prayer on lips and joke in heart. Because if we no laugh, the weight go crush. So next time you hear threat or switch, just shake head and say, "Na so e be." But deep down, believe say better day dey load, courtesy of the one wey never fails. And that's the punch: in a world of threats and jumps, only faith no dey switch side.
