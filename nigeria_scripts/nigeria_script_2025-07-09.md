Omo! My people, una good evening o! How body? Hope say the NEPA no carry light for your area tonight? Because if dem do, na me una go blame abi?

So, I been dey read the news this week, and ehn… Nigeria just dey give me constant content. Free of charge! God bless Nigeria and its… peculiarities.

I saw on Reddit, somebody dey complain say US dey retaliate on our students visa matter. Wait, wait, wait… so we started it? Na we first show shege to oyibo students? Nigeria wey still dey beg for investment? Bros, sometimes I think our government dey play chess with pigeons. Dem go scatter the board, shit everywhere, then strut around like dem win.

And speaking of winning, how market for the Naira? Dem say e dey develop muscle. Ehn? Muscle wey dey disappear every time oil price sneeze? Abeg, I don hear that story before. Last time I heard Naira was strong, I went to buy gala, dem tell me say na 200 naira now! Gala! What is gala even made of? Mystery meat and dashed dreams?

Then I see one photo of Oga at the top. I no go mention name, make EFCC no come my house. But ehn, the man dey look…presidential. Like say he just win lottery and dem announce am on Channels TV, but e forget say e still dey wear agbada wey get stain of yesterday's amala. This is the person representing us oh! Representing! I’m telling you, leadership in Nigeria is like Nollywood – plenty drama, questionable acting, and the plot twist always involves money.

And speaking of money...23 million for a fairly used Camaro? Bros, for that kain money, I fit buy three tokunbo Corollas and still have change to bribe NEPA for steady light for one year! Who dey buy Camaro for Lagos roads sef? Where you wan drive am to? From Lekki to Epe? Before you reach Chevron, pot holes don chop the tires finish!

But the real question be this: How do people maintain faith in these times? I swear, I lost my own faith when I saw the price of bread double in one week. Used to be I could buy bread, share with my neighbour...now? I am eyeing my neighbour's bread jealously like say na him steal my last kobo.

This tribe matter sef...intercultural marriage. Igbo and Yoruba? My people, love is blind, dem say. But marriage? Marriage dey open eye wide like say NEPA bill just land. I went to a wedding recently – Igbo bride, Yoruba groom. The MC spent more time explaining the difference between egusi and ewedu than celebrating the couple. At the end, dem nearly fight over who go pay the bill. Omo, marriage na battlefield o!

Me sef, I remember when I first go Yankee. I carry my Naija confidence go there, dey speak pidgin with everybody. I nearly enter trouble when I call one policeman "Oga." He look me one kain way, I quickly switch to "Officer, suh!" Learn quick, quick!

But seriously, Nigeria, ehn? We are a special breed. We complain, we shout, we even threaten to japa. But we still dey here, dey hustle, dey laugh, dey find joy in the midst of madness. Why? Because deep down, we know say if we no laugh, we go cry. And who get time to cry when Gala price dey increase every day? So, make we raise our bottles…to Nigeria! May our leaders eventually remember say dem dey work for us, not the other way around. And may NEPA finally give us light, so we can see the madness clearly! Cheers!
