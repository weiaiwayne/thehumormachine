Wetin dey happen for this our country sef, my people? I dey look this PDP convention wey dem dey threaten to scatter am, like say na wedding be that one wey bridegroom no show. Aspirants screening don halt, e be like dem say na exam be that, but teacher no mark paper. Shey you sabi that feeling when you prepare for big test, read all night, only for invigilator to say, hold on, we no ready? That's PDP right now, dem dey do like say politics na Nollywood script wey director change mind midway. And me, I dey wonder, if dem no screen aspirants, who go lead us? Na the one wey sabi dance shaku shaku or the one wey fit beg for forgiveness like prodigal son? Because in Naija, leadership no be about plan, na about who fit survive the wahala.

That one take me to this climate policy matter wey dey give Nigeria coordination wahala. Ehn, coordination? Like say our leaders dey try arrange orchestra but half dem no sabi play instrument. Dem talk say we go fight climate change, plant trees, reduce emissions, but look road, dem still dey build estates on flood-prone areas. I remember that time for village, rain fall, whole compound turn river, and papa say, God's got the clouds under control, but government? Dem dey build bridges wey wash away next season. Shey you understand? We dey face drought up north, flood down south, and policy makers dey meet for air-conditioned halls, sipping chilled malt, promising green future. But green like dollar or green like envy? Because if na dollar, count me in, but if na envy, I no want am. And in all this, one thing sure: when heaven open tap, no be policy go save you, na faith go remind you say rainbow come after storm, like Noah's own.

Speaking of north, this hunger crisis for northern Nigeria don turn documentary material, but e no funny on empty belle. Dem show film about people wey dey trek miles for water, kids wey no sabi when last dem chop protein pass garri. And me, I think, how body go survive when farm no yield, herder-farmer clash everywhere? It's like God plant garden for Eden, but now na desert we dey farm. Politicians send relief, rice bags wey reach few villages, but the queue long like burial procession. One time, I join queue for palliative, sun dey beat, sweat dey pour, and the woman beside me whisper, brother, this one na test of patience, like Job in Bible, but Job get wife wey complain, we no even get that. Shey e no tire you? We dey pray for daily bread, but dem dey give us crumbs wrapped in politics. At least, faith teach say man no live by bread alone, but e sweet when bread dey, abi?

Now, let me yarn you about this Senate President Akpabio, the man wey his actions dey spark controversy like matchstick for petrol station. Ehn, what did he do this time? Dem say im moves dey shake the chamber, like earthquake for Red Chamber. One day na suspension, next na probe, it's like im dey direct action movie but budget na senate allowance. I dey imagine am sitted there, gavel in hand, banging like pastor calling sinners to altar. But instead of repentance, na debate on bills wey no pass. And the controversy? People dey talk say na power play, but me I see am as Nigerian classic: promise change, deliver drama. You know how we dey? Leader rise, shine, then fall into another scandal quicker than iPhone battery. But here's the hope part: even when senate dey argue, God's word say iron sharpen iron, so maybe from this fire, better leadership go emerge, like gold from furnace. No be so?

That senate matter remind me of this energy investment wey Nigeria secure, eight billion dollars, e sound like jackpot for Baba Ijebu, but shey e go light up our homes? Dem talk say investors dey come, power plants, renewables, but I dey fear say na another promise wey go fade like morning dew. Because in Naija, money enter, project start, then vanish into thin air, like magician's rabbit. One brother tell me, if dem use that eight billion buy generators for every house, we go need fuel to run am, and fuel price? E dey climb like Mount Everest. But wait, oil unions dey challenge refinery deals, extending naira payment for crude, e be like family feud over inheritance. Shey you see the irony? We get oil, but no refine am well, now unions dey fight like siblings over papa land. And in the midst, ordinary man dey suffer blackout, phone dey charge slow, business dey fold. But faith dey whisper, light come from above, not just from grid, so even when darkness fall, prayer go spark hope, like candle in night.

Ehn, and this talk of helping Nigerian Christians, people dey ask how, like say na puzzle. From abroad, dem send money, pray, but here inside, we dey face persecution subtle, like tax on church or policy wey no favor. One pastor friend say, we no need pity, we need justice, because Bible talk say blessed are the peacemakers, not the fighters. But in Naija, peace na scarce commodity, especially when politics mix with faith. Imagine politician come church, drop envelope, promise heaven on earth, but deliver potholes. Shey e no laugh you? We dey sing "Great is Thy Faithfulness" while dodging okada in rain, but that's our testimony: even in chaos, grace hold us, like anchor in storm.

Now, shift gear small, this extraordinary Nigerian teen wey dem dey hail, kid wey invent something or win award, e inspire, abi? In middle of all this madness, one youth rise, show say future bright. But wait, how many such teens dey jobless, hustling for street? Dem graduate, CV long like novel, but vacancy short like short story. Government talk tackle unemployment, but action? Na seminar and promise. USA dey do one thing, we dey copy but twist am to our style: add jara of delay. And Igbos in Lagos dey yarn say one Nigeria na mirage, like oasis in desert, you see am but no reach. Sanwo-Olu talk challenged coexistence, Lagos most dangerous state? Ehn, dangerous like love triangle or traffic jam? Because in Lagos, no, wait, I no go talk Lagos deep, but everywhere, we dey coexist by force, like oil and water in same pot.

That take me to this travel wahala, person dey ask how to go from Abuja to Kano without flying, as tourist. Ehn, brother, you wan experience Naija adventure? Take bus, but prepare for story: driver dey speed like formula one, pit stop na buka wey serve pepper soup wey burn belle. Road dey rough, potholes like moon crater, and along way, you go see villages wey time stop, kids waving like celebrities. But why no fly? Fear turbulence or wan feel the pulse? In Naija, journey na half the fun, or half the wahala, depending on your luck. And if rain fall, na biblical flood, but you go survive, because resilience na our middle name.

One more thing, this ranking Nigerian foods, people dey debate online, like say na world cup. Pounded yam versus eba, soup wey sweet pass or the one wey fill belle? But in hunger time, any food na king. And confessions of Nigerian drummer, that one sweet, man dey beat drum for occasions, from wedding to burial, life rhythm. He say, every beat tell story, joy or sorrow, but keep going. That's Naija spirit: drum no stop, even when life hard.

Finally, this Tinubu government reply to IMF, say unrealistic to fix problems in two years, e be like doctor telling patient, your wahala deep, no quick fix. But we know, Rome no build in day, and Nigeria? E go take grace of God plus plenty prayer. So, my people, in all this political circus, climate dance, hunger march, and energy promise, hold on to faith, because politicians may falter, but the one above never fails. And if life throw curveball, laugh am off, like we dey do here. Peace!
