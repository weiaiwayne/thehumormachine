### **Overarching Theme: Algorithmic Culture and National Identity**
How does an AI, by curating and reinterpreting online discourse, construct and reflect contemporary Nigerian national identity and its attendant anxieties?

---

### **Research Question 1: Thematic Resonance and Agenda-Setting**
**RQ:** To what extent do the AI-generated scripts reflect the dominant conversational themes present on their source platforms (like Nairaland and Reddit)? Can the AI be seen as an agenda-setter or merely a mirror of the existing digital public sphere?

*   **Hypothesis 1a (Mirror Hypothesis):** The frequency of topics in the AI scripts (e.g., President Tinubu's policies, NEPA/PHCN failures, "japa" culture) will show a strong positive correlation with the frequency of those same topics on the specified Nigerian subreddits and Nairaland forums in the 24-48 hours preceding the script's generation.
*   **Hypothesis 1b (Amplification Hypothesis):** The AI will not only reflect but also amplify the most emotionally charged or conflict-oriented topics (e.g., political criticism, inter-ethnic tension, injustice) due to their higher engagement metrics on the source platforms, making these themes appear more central in the scripts than they are in the overall discourse.

### **Research Question 2: Linguistic Style and Code-Switching**
**RQ:** How does the AI utilize Nigerian Pidgin English, Standard Nigerian English, and code-switching to establish authenticity and comedic effect?

*   **Hypothesis 2a:** The AI will strategically use Nigerian Pidgin for punchlines, expressions of frustration (e.g., "Na wa o!"), and direct address to the audience ("How una dey?") to create a sense of shared identity and informal rapport.
*   **Hypothesis 2b:** Standard Nigerian English will be reserved for quoting official sources or describing formal political concepts (e.g., "Renewed Hope," "low female representation"), creating a comedic juxtaposition with the Pidgin commentary that follows.

### **Research Question 3: Representation and Stereotypes**
**RQ:** How does the AI construct and represent key figures and groups within Nigerian society (e.g., politicians like Tinubu and Peter Obi, ethnic groups, religious leaders, and ordinary citizens)?

*   **Hypothesis 3a:** The AI's portrayal of political figures will be predominantly critical and satirical, aligning with the cynical tone often found in online political forums, framing them as disconnected from the everyday struggles of the populace.
*   **Hypothesis 3b:** The "ordinary Nigerian" is consistently framed as a resilient, long-suffering but humorous individual, whose primary concerns are socio-economic (electricity, cost of living, infrastructure), reinforcing a national identity built on "suffering and smiling."

### **Research Question 4: Humor as a Social Mechanism**
**RQ:** What are the primary functions of humor in the AI-generated scripts? Is it primarily for coping, social critique, or building in-group solidarity?

*   **Hypothesis 4a (Coping Mechanism):** The most frequent comedic trope will be the juxtaposition of high national aspirations (e.g., "Giant of Africa," AI development) with the mundane failures of public services (e.g., lack of electricity, bad roads, long queues), functioning as a collective coping mechanism for shared frustrations.
*   **Hypothesis 4b (Social Critique):** The jokes will function as a form of "safe" political critique, using humor to point out corruption, injustice (e.g., the Ogbonna Igbojionu case), and policy failures that would be more dangerous to state directly.

### **Research Question 5: Human-Computer Interaction and Authenticity**
**RQ:** If an audience were unaware of the AI's role, would they perceive the scripts as authentically human-generated Nigerian comedy? What textual cues contribute to or detract from this perception?

*   **Hypothesis 5a:** Audiences will rate the scripts as authentically human due to the culturally specific references (NEPA, jollof rice, agbada, owambe), the correct use of Pidgin, and the relatable nature of the grievances expressed.
*   **Hypothesis 5b:** A critical discourse analysis will reveal subtle signs of its AI origin, such as the rapid, almost checklist-like integration of multiple, disparate trending topics from its source data within a single monologue, a pattern that may be less focused than a typical human comedian's set.
