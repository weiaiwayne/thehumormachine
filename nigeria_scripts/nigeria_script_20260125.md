Ah, my brothers and sisters, e be like say our political scene don turn to one endless telenovela where everybody dey switch roles faster than a market woman changing her wrapper for rainy day. Take this Bayelsa governor, Douye Diri, wey just dump PDP join APC like say e discover say the grass for other side get better fertilizer. You know how e dey be? One day you dey red, next day you dey blue, and the followers just follow like sheep wey see fresh pasture. Me I dey wonder, if politicians fit change parties like that, why una no let us change our utility bills same way? Abeg, if NEPA take my light, I go switch to solar without paying extra fee. But no, dem go tax you for breathing. Shey you see the irony? E get as e be, but in all this flip-flopping, remember say true loyalty no dey in colors, e dey in the heart – like how David stick to his sling against Goliath, no switching sides mid-battle.

Now, speaking of battles, wetin dey happen with this American drama wey dey pull our leaders into the ring? President Trump over there dey talk military action against us, like say Nigeria na one small village wey e fit invade for fun. And our oga for Aso Rock summon all foreign diplomats to Abuja, e be like emergency family meeting where everybody come explain wetin dey cook. Chai, imagine the scene: envoys from everywhere sitting down, sweating under AC wey fit bill itself, while our people dey yarn about peace and diplomacy. Trump say threat, we say talk, e be like Nollywood where villain shout but hero just smile and negotiate. Me I laugh, because if e true reach action, una think say our soldiers go fold? No o, dem go respond with that Naija spirit wey turn obstacle to opportunity. But seriously, in this global wahala, e remind me say peace no come from guns or big talks, e come from higher place – like how Jesus calm the storm with just one word, no need for summit or envoy.

Oya, let me shift to this doctors' strike wey government dey try end, as if na small quarrel for barbing salon. Resident doctors fold arm, hospitals turn to ghost towns, and patients dey pray make miracle happen quick-quick. Government say dem go fix am, promise salary and conditions, but e too late pass pepper soup wey don cold. You know how e dey pain? That uncle wey dey market, e get high blood pressure, now e dey manage with agbo from herbalist because hospital dey on holiday. E be like say healthcare na luxury for here, reserved for those wey fit travel abroad or bribe their way. Me sef, last time I fall sick, I tell my wife, "Babe, if I no wake, bury me with my health insurance card – at least e go serve as tombstone." But truth, this strike show say we need more than promises; we need action wey heal the nation, like the grace wey turn water to wine, making scarcity into abundance without drama.

And ehn, while all this dey happen, our Lagos big man, Sanwo-Olu, dey appeal to global investors about climate change, like say Lagos na frontline for saving the world. E yarn about international climate summit, begging for funds to fix flood and heat wey dey fry us like plantain for hot oil. Shey you hear? E say renewed appeal, as if last one no work because investors dey wait for better pitch. But o boy, in this city where danfo dey swim through water during rain, and people dey build on swamp like say e na solid rock, wetin climate change go change? We dey face am daily – okada wey skid on wet road, market women wey lose goods to flood, all while politicians dey pose with fancy reports. Me I think, if investors come, make dem bring the money and the tech, but no forget the people wey go implement am. After all, stewardship over earth na biblical charge, from Genesis where God hand over garden; we no fit just talk, we must tend am with wisdom, no be just photo op.

Now, on a lighter note, Tinubu congratulate former military head, Babangida, on him 84th birthday, like old pals catching up after long time. IBB, the gap-toothed general wey rule back in the day, now dey collect well-wishes like grandpa wey survive multiple coups. E be sweet, abi? Shows say even in politics wey full of knives, time go heal some wounds, and people fit still shake hands. But imagine the party: cake with 84 candles wey fit light up the whole estate, and stories wey span from annulment to now. Me sef, if I reach that age, I no go want politician congrats; I go want my grandchildren around, sharing jollof without argument. E remind me say birthdays no be about power or past glories, dem be about the joy wey endure, like the eternal life promise wey no fade with years.

E get this other angle with NNPC and that refinery deal, extending crude supply on naira basis, like say dem finally find way to keep oil local without dollar wahala. Talks dey go on, promising stability for fuel and economy, but we don hear such yarn before – pipeline wey leak promise, only to burst later. You know how e be for market? Seller say "This cloth na original, no fade," but after one wash, e turn rag. So, if this deal work, halleluyah, prices go drop and generators go rest; if not, na back to queue and black market. But in faith, we hold on, because even when deals fail, the provider wey feed ravens no go forget his children.

Ah, my people, all these political twists – from party jumps to international threats, strikes to climate pleas – e show say Naija life na mix of chaos and resilience. We laugh to survive, yarn to unite, and pray for better tomorrow. But at the end, when all the noise quiet, remember say the real change no come from summit or switch, e come from hearts turned right, like prodigal son wey return home. And if politicians no deliver, at least we get comedy to light the way. So, next time you see governor cross line or envoy summoned, just smile and say, "Na God dey run am," because in him plot, even the twists lead to triumph.
