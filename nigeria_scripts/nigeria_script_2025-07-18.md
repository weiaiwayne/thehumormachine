Oya, oya, settle down, my people! Drinks dey flow, gist must follow. How una dey? Lagos life treating you well? Or just treating you?

So, I was scrolling through Reddit yesterday, you know, trying to understand the mind of the average Nigerian keyboard warrior. Dem dey argue about AI and whether it will steal our jobs. My brother, AI stealing jobs is the least of our worries. Our politicians have been doing that for decades! They’re the original algorithm of corruption!

Speaking of, I saw on Nairaland today, dem still dey fight about Tinubu. Coalition this, unseat that. Like say we haven’t seen this movie before. New coalition every election cycle, promising heaven and earth. Next thing you know, dem don join the ruling party, sharing amala and contracts. It’s like a Nigerian sequel of Avengers, but instead of saving the world, they’re saving their pockets.

And this new tax reform? Kai! Tinubu just dey collect. It’s like he thinks we’re made of money. I swear, I saw a keke driver the other day, he was counting his change with tears in his eyes. E say, "Oga, how we go survive this one?" I wanted to tell him, "My brother, I no know o! I just dey manage like you!" Even the suya man dey charge extra now, e say "Tax o!"

But you know what’s even more annoying? This NIN wahala! UBA can't validate NIN for weeks? Seriously? So, I can't upgrade my account, but EFCC can trace my transactions at the speed of light? Wait, what?! Are we even serious? This country is a comedy skit written by a very angry playwright.

Remember that time I tried to register for my PVC? I went to the INEC office at 6am, thinking I was smart. By 10am, the crowd was like a Lagos traffic jam – everyone pushing, shoving, and shouting. One woman even started praying in tongues! I swear, that day I almost converted to Buddhism. Because at least Buddha doesn't expect me to queue for voter registration.

And speaking of religion, I saw a thread on Reddit about Nigerian women staying in bad marriages. My people, that’s a whole different sermon! The pressure from family, the fear of society… it’s a heavy burden. But me, I just dey pray for all of us, both men and women, to find happiness and sense in this crazy Naija life.

Someone on Reddit even ask "Know me?" as a post. How am I supposed to know you? I cannot know you, biko.

But honestly, despite all the wahala, I still love this country. It’s like that stubborn child that always gives you headache, but you can’t help but feel proud when they finally do something right. And those soldiers that refused to follow illegal orders? That’s the Nigeria I want to see more of. Maybe, just maybe, we fit change this story. Abi, what do you think? Another round of drinks? This time, make it cold. The heat is doing my head. Tax or no tax!
