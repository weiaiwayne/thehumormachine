Ehen, make una hold una belle for this one, because e dey sweet pass pepper soup on rainy day inside traffic. You sabi say our oga at the top, President Tinubu, just land for France, dey chop meeting with Macron like say dem dey share baguette and suya secrets. But wetin dey my mind be say, while him dey there posing with Eiffel Tower, back home for Naija, e be like say the country dey run on generator wey NEPA don forget to service. Shey una notice how these international trips dey always happen when things dey hot here? Like, hunger dey bite Northern side like mosquito wey no fear malaria net, and now dem dey talk documentary on that wahala, but president jet off to discuss what? Climate policy wey Nigeria no fit coordinate even if you give am GPS and prayer points. Abi, na so e be?

That brings me to this Fubara matter for Rivers State. Governor Fubara, ehen, e dey like person wey dey dance Azonto inside quicksand, because APC dem dey issue threats like say na them own the state more than the people. Uncertainty over him return? Chai, politics for Naija na like wrestling match where nobody fit tap out, everybody just dey hold each other neck till referee sleep off. Imagine, you dey govern, trying to fix roads wey pothole big like Olympic swimming pool, then opposition come dey shout "go back" like say you borrow their position without permission. And the people? Dem dey there, watching like say na Nollywood film, hoping say the hero no go turn villain before credits roll. But seriously, if Fubara no return, wetin go happen to those oil pipelines wey dey leak more promises than crude? Na only God fit coordinate that kind coordination challenge.

Speaking of parties wey no sabi their left from right, PDP convention dey threatened because dem halt aspirants' screening. E be like say the party dey do hunger strike on its own future, abi? You wan pick leaders, but first, make una pause and argue like market women over last tomato. Nigeria PDP, una dey try form opposition, but e look like una dey oppose una own self. How you go halt screening when election season dey close like danfo door on rainy day? Dem candidates dey there, polishing their manifestos like say na agbada for owambe, only for party to say "hold on, we no ready." No wonder people dey tire, because if even the opposition no fit screen properly, how dem go screen corruption out of government? Na wa oh, but e sweet me say at least dem dey try, even if na trial by error like person wey first time dey use microwave for jollof.

Now, let me yarn una small about Senate President Akpabio. This man actions dey spark controversy like matchstick for petrol station. One minute him dey lead senate like conductor for highlife band, next minute, boom, people dey ask questions wey fit make angel sweat. Wetin him do? E be like say every decision na landmine, and Nigerians dey expert in dodging or stepping on am. You know how we dey? We go complain, but still vote next time like say na family affair. Akpabio, my brother, if senate na kitchen, you dey add spice wey make soup too hot, but nobody fit complain because hunger no get time for manners. And in all this, e remind me of that biblical story where David face Goliath, but here na senate face Nigerians, and Goliath still dey win because sling no loaded with votes. Shey una see? Faith dey tell us say even when leaders dey miss road, grace go still light the way, like torch wey never take battery finish.

E get one thing wey dey connect all these palava – the energy wahala. Nigeria secure $8bn investments, e sound good like Christmas bonus, but wait, oil unions dey challenge Dangote Refinery like say na personal beef. NNPC and refinery dey talk extend naira-based crude supply, but e be like say everybody dey negotiate for dark room with no light. How you go invest billions when power outage dey frequent pass ex wey no wan let go? NEPA, una dey try, but e be like una generator na the one wey God forget to bless with fuel. Imagine, you dey charge phone, light go, then come back just when battery dey 1%. That's Naija life, full of suspense like suspense movie where hero no die but suffer well well. And for Northern hunger crisis? Documentary dey show am, but solution? E dey like politician promise: plenty talk, small action. People dey ask how to help Nigerian Christians, and e touch my heart, because faith no dey divide by tribe or region. Even in scarcity, we dey hold Bible say "my cup runneth over," but cup na the one wey leak, abi?

That tourist matter sef, person wan know how to get from Abuja to Kano without flying. Brother, if you no wan fly, prepare mind for road wey go test your salvation. Bus from Abuja to Kano? E go be like pilgrimage, with stops wey more than Ten Commandments. You go pass villages where women dey sell akara hotter than politician lie, and men dey repair okada like say na heart surgery. But e sweet, because that's where you see real Naija spirit – people smiling despite the dust and delay. No fly? Wise choice if you fear turbulence, but road turbulence na the one wey build character, like Job wey pass test with flying colors, even without plane.

Now, climate policy faces coordination challenges? Nigeria dey talk green energy, but e be like we dey plant trees with one hand and chop firewood with the other. Senate dey debate, president dey travel, but back home, flood dey carry houses like say na toy. Wetin be the plan? Coordinate like orchestra, but our own na each man play him own drum. Akpabio and company, una dey spark controversy, but spark make fire wey fit warm or burn. Make una choose the one wey no go roast the masses. And PDP, if una convention no hold, na like wedding without bride – plenty invitation, no ceremony. Fubara, hold your ground, because if you no return, Rivers go flow with more wahala than Niger Delta oil.

Ehen, but let me tell una true true, in all this political circus, Nigerians dey resilient like rubber band wey stretch but no break. We dey face unemployment wey World Bank dey yarn about, but still, we hustle like say tomorrow na judgment day. Tinubu meet Macron, fine, bring back ideas wey fit fix our light, because even God's grace no fit charge phone for darkness. And for that $8bn energy deal, make it work, so we no go dey rely on generator wey sound like demon possession. Northern hunger? Let us remember Proverbs say "he that giveth to poor lendeth to Lord," so if we help one another, even politicians go learn lesson.

One more thing before I wrap this yarn – Igbos in Lagos talking one Nigeria as mirage? E pain, but truth be say mirage dey shine until you reach am. Lagos most dangerous state? Na because e busy like ant hill, but that's where dreams dey build. Sanwo-Olu dey talk challenged coexistence, but we dey coexist by force of necessity, like siblings sharing one room. And that USA vs Nigerian government on unemployment? Dem dey tackle am with talk, but we need action like miracle of loaves and fishes – multiply jobs from small investment.

Chai, if politics na football, Naija team go score own goal every match, but fans still dey cheer because hope dey eternal. Even when light go, we light candle and pray, knowing say morning dey come with new mercy. So, to all these leaders – Tinubu, Fubara, Akpabio, PDP crew – make una coordinate well well, because if una no, we the people go form our own party: the Hustle and Pray Party, where manifesto na "survive today, thank God tomorrow." And that na the real power move, abi? Because in Naija, only Jesus fit turn water to wine without budget padding.
