Eh, my brothers and sisters, make we yarn about this our country wey dey turn like akara for hot oil every day. You sabi that governor from Bayelsa wey just jump ship from that old party wey dey like faded wrapper, straight into the other camp wey dey shine like new agbada? E be like say na wetin dey happen when person tire of one jollof and wan chop another. I mean, one minute you dey loyal like dog to bone, next thing you don dey hail new master. Shey na hunger or what? Or maybe na the way politics dey sweet like chin-chin when you dey win. But e get mind, abi? Imagine if marriage be like that – wife see better offer, she pack go next house. Na so e go be? Omo, our leaders fit teach us plenty lessons, but make dem no teach us that one o.

That one wey dey make me shake head pass na how our top brass don gather all those oyibo envoys for one big palava over threat from that American big man wey talk say e go send soldiers come scatter our peace. Chai, imagine! Person wey dey watch too much Hollywood film now wan export am to our side. E be like say dem dey rehearse for Nollywood epic, but with real guns. And our side, dem dey calm everybody, say na just talk, we go handle am with sweet words and handshakes. Me, I dey wonder – wetin be the plan B if words no work? We go dance shakushaku or sing highlife to cool temper? Or maybe summon pastors to pray for border protection. Because, see eh, in this life, sometimes you need more than diplomacy; you need that divine intervention wey no dey fail. Like how Bible talk say, greater is He wey dey inside than that one wey dey outside. So, if soldiers wan come, make dem know say our God na ultimate commander-in-chief.

Now, let us shift to this fuel matter wey dem don do U-turn sharper than okada for pothole. One day, dem announce 15 percent charge on imports, next day, e vanish like gen noise for midnight. E be like policy wey dey play hide-and-seek with us. You think say e go bite, but poof, e don go. Why now? Maybe dem hear the cry of okada riders and market women wey go feel am for pocket. Or perhaps na the way economy dey twist like rope, dem say make we no add more wahala. But seriously, my people, this up-and-down na the real Nigerian dance. One step forward, two back, then spin. And while dem dey decide, we still dey queue for black market, praying say pump no dry before our turn. E remind me of that grace wey Bible promise – sufficient for the day. Because if not for that, how we go survive these twists without losing mind? Dem fit change policy overnight, but God's plan no dey flip-flop.

Speaking of health, you hear say dem wan end that strike wey doctors dey do, the ones wey dey save lives but no fit save their own salary? E be like family quarrel wey everybody dey suffer. Patients dey wait, hospitals empty like church on weekday, and leaders dey rush to table to beg peace. Good move, sha, but why e reach that level first? Na so e be with us – we go let fire burn small before we fetch water. Imagine if Jesus na doctor for Naija hospital; e go heal all, collect no fee, and strike? Never. E go say, come unto me all ye wey labor, and I go give una rest – plus free consultation. But our own doctors, dem deserve better; make dem no dey beg for what dem earn with sweat. This strike na mirror for our whole system – broken, but fixable if we apply little wisdom from above.

Eh, and that refinery deal wey NNPC dey negotiate with private big boy, extending supply with our own money instead of dollars? Smart play, or so dem say. E be like borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, but inside family. No more oyibo currency wahala; we go use what we get. But me, I dey fear say e fit turn to another 419 if no eyes dey watch. You know how these things dey – promise heaven, deliver smoke. Still, e show say we dey try stand on own feet, no more crawling to IMF or World Bank every time. Like prodigal son wey come back home, wiser, ready to manage inheritance well. If e work, na blessing; if not, well, we go pray for redemption arc.

Now, let me paint picture from Anambra side, where our top man get praise for staying neutral in that local contest. Neutral like Switzerland, abi? No side, just watch. E be rare o, in our politics wey everybody dey pick team like football match. But neutral? That means no wahala for anybody, or so dem think. Lagos chapter of that ruling group dey hail am, say e wise. Me, I say e clever – stay out, let dem fight, then claim victory later. Like referee wey no blow whistle until goal score. And we, the watchers, wey go chop the fallout? We go manage with prayers, hoping say peace win at the end. Because, as Ecclesiastes talk, there's time for everything – time to pick side, time to sit fence.

You see, all these palava dey show say our land na pot of stew, full of spice and sometimes pepper wey burn tongue. Governors switching like channel, threats from afar like bad dream, policies flipping faster than pancake, doctors marching for rights, deals wey promise better days. But through it all, we dey hold on, laughing to survive. Because if we no laugh, wetin remain? Cry? No, we go yarn, we go jest, and we go trust say better morning dey come, as promised in that good book. Even when leaders miss step, grace dey catch us. So, my people, make we keep eyes open, mouths ready for gist, and hearts fixed on higher power. After all, in Naija, comedy na our shield, and faith na our sword. Who knows, maybe next week, another twist – but we go be ready, with joke on tip of tongue.
