Ehen, my people, make una hear this one wey dey make me shake head like person wey see ghost for broad daylight. You see this our oga at the top, President Tinubu, him don jet go France again, shaking hands with Macron like say dem dey plan wedding for Paris. Chai, imagine, while we here dey manage with small-small breeze from fan, him dey there sipping wine with Eiffel Tower for background. No be small thing o, but wetin I dey think be say, if e fit carry all this international style come back, maybe him go fix that our road wey dey swallow tire like say na python. Or ehen, perhaps him and Macron don sign deal to send baguette come change our bread scarcity, abi you no agree?

Now, speaking of deals, I see say NNPC and that big refinery people dey talk to extend supply with naira, no more dollar wahala. E sweet my belle die, because last time, e be like dem dey play chess with our money, and we na the pawns wey dey get chop. But wait o, if dem extend this naira thing, e mean say fuel price go crash or what? No o, e go probably mean say queue for station go still be like church service on Sunday, everybody praying but nobody moving. Me sef, I dey imagine: driver wey dey wait for hours, him go start to preach sermon on top bonnet, "Brethren, the Lord will provide petrol today!" And the queue go answer, "Amen!" But seriously, eight billion dollars for energy investment? That money fit build school wey go teach our pikin how to code instead of how to dodge pothole. Yet, dem go probably use am to paint new office for Aso Rock, shining like new penny while we still dey use lantern for night.

That one don remind me of this Senate President Akpabio wey actions dey spark fire everywhere. E get one matter wey him do, now everybody dey ask question like exam hall. Him dey try to lead the house, but e be like say him dey dance azonto on minefield. You know that feeling when family head dey promise peace but end up starting argument over who eat last rice? Na so e be. Akpabio, my brother, if you wan lead well, no be by jumping up and down like frog for rainy season. Take am easy, use wisdom from above, because even Bible talk say tongue fit set forest on fire, no need to add kerosene. And uncertainty over Fubara return with APC threats? E be like Nollywood script wey director forget ending. One side dey shout "come back," other side dey hiss "no entry." Me, I dey wonder if dem fit just sit down, share kola nut, and let peace reign like in old village meeting. But no, politicians go prefer to drag am till everybody tire, while we the watchers dey eat popcorn from afar.

Ehen, let me shift to this extraordinary teen from our side wey dey blow mind. This kid, small-small boy, but him talent dey shine like morning sun. E no be those fake wonder wey come and go; na real one wey make you believe say future bright. Imagine, for middle of all this economic squeeze, where job dey scarce like gold, this young one dey show say with grace from God, you fit rise above. No be by connection or who you know, but by that inner fire wey Holy Spirit kindle. I remember my own time for village, when I small, mama go say, "Chijioke, read your book, God go open door." Now see this teen, him don open gate wey even adult dey knock for years. E inspire me to tell una: even when bill dey pile up like mountain, and boss dey cut salary like barber wey no sabi work, hold on to that faith. Because politicians fit promise heaven on earth, but only the one upstairs deliver without fine print.

Now, wetin dey happen for market these days? Chai, go there, you go see drama wey fit win Oscar. Seller dey hail you, "Aunty, buy this cloth, e go make you fine pass angel!" But when you touch am, e thin like paper for wrapping. And price? E don climb higher than ladder to heaven. Me sef, last time I go buy yam, woman dey charge me like say na diamond. I tell her, "Madam, this na food or investment?" She laugh and say, "Both o, because tomorrow e go cost more." Economic struggle no be joke, but we Nigerians get way to turn am to comedy. Family go gather for dinner, papa go say, "Today we thank God for this small stew," and everybody go chorus, "Amen, at least e better than nothing." That resilience na our superpower, mixed with prayer wey no dey fail. No wonder even in tough times, church full every Sunday, because we know say redemption come from above, no from any policy paper.

But let me yarn una about this meeting with new service chiefs for Aso Rock. Tinubu gather dem, probably to talk strategy, like coach with team before match. E good sha, because security na big matter for us. But e be like say dem dey plan to catch thief, yet pickpocket still dey operate for bus stop. I dey hope say from this meeting, go come out plan wey go make street safe, so that mama wey dey hawk for corner no go dey fear shadow. And with that French visit, maybe dem don talk about tech to help our forces, no more old gun wey jam for middle of action. Imagine soldier wey phone dey ring instead of shoot – "Hello, enemy? Wait, battery low!" No o, we need upgrade, and faith to back am up. Because as Proverbs talk, preparation meet opportunity, and with God's help, we go win.

Shifting gear small, I see say our country secure eight billion for energy, big win abi? But the question be, how e go reach the common man? No be say dem go drop money for our pocket direct; na through project wey go take time. In meantime, we still dey manage with candlelight vigil every evening, turning blackout to prayer meeting. "Lord, bring light!" And sometimes, e feel like miracle happen when bulb finally glow. That na the beauty of our life – turning lemon to lemonade with dash of scripture. Even when investment dey come, we no dey sleep; we dey hustle, pray, and laugh through it. Because if no be so, madness go take over.

One more thing wey dey tickle me: this talk of helping Christians here. Person dey ask, "How can I help?" Simple o, start by sharing what you get, no matter how small. Visit church, support orphanage, or just listen to uncle wey dey complain about life. E no need big money; na heart matter. And in all, remember that grace dey cover multitude of sin, even politician own. So, as Tinubu dey meet world leaders, and Akpabio dey stir pot, we go keep pushing with hope wey no disappoint. Because at the end, the greatest investment na in soul, and that one, no dollar fit buy.

Ehen, my people, if all this no make you smile, then check your mirror – perhaps you need to practice that faith smile. And remember, even in craziest times, God's plan dey weave through like thread in cloth. Stay blessed, stay funny, and keep believing.
