Ehen, good evening, my people! How una dey? You know, I was just on Reddit, seeing what the oyinbo dem are saying about us. And Nairaland too. You know, the usual suspects, arguing like say jollof rice recipe dey depend on am.

But ehn, the ting wey dey my mind tonight, na this Naija politics. Chai! E be like say drama no dey finish. Like say scriptwriters dey vex say Nollywood dey chop all the salary.

Remember that election tribunal? The one wey everybody dey hold their breath, waiting for the verdict like say NEPA go bring light? Eventually, the judges confirmed say Governor Gandollar… I mean, Governor Ganduje’s successor, Abba Kabir Yusuf, won legitimately. Legitimately! After all the stories, the accusations, the… *cough*… “allegations” of monetary influence? Ah, Nigeria! Always keeping us entertained. You know, I heard say one judge nearly fainted from reading the petitions. Too much grammar, too much wahala.

Speaking of Ganduje… that man! From stuffing dollars in his babariga, to now being the APC National Chairman. Na promotion be that o! I swear, Nigeria is the only place you can allegedly steal enough money to build a small city, and then get rewarded with more responsibility. Wait, what? Are we sure we are even serious as a country?

And these coalitions ehn? Everybody forming alliance, changing parties like say dem dey change boxers. Today you’re PDP, tomorrow you're APC, next week you don turn Labour Party. E be like say loyalty na just another word for “opportunity.” The only alliance wey I trust na the one between amala and ewedu. Dat one dey consistent!

And women in politics? Hmmm. Make I just talk small because if I talk too much, dem go say I be misogynist. But honestly, where are the women? We need more Madam Ngozis and fewer “behind every successful man…” stories. Honestly, ehn, sometimes I think we need to start rigging elections *for* women. I’m not saying it’s right, I’m just saying maybe that’s the level we’ve reached. Desperate times, desperate measures. Don't arrest me o! I'm joking…mostly.

You know, I was talking to my cousin, Ifeanyi, the other day. He just came back from Japa – from Canada. He said he missed the madness. He missed the chaos. He missed the… well, everything that makes Nigeria, Nigeria. He even missed NEPA! Can you imagine? Missing NEPA! I told him, "Ifeanyi, you're a madman. Are you sure the Canadian weather hasn't affected your brain?" But deep down, I understood. Because as much as we complain, as much as we vex, this is home.

Even with Boko Haram still disturbing our peace. This ting is still going on? When will peace reign?

And remember that election tribunal earlier? It's funny, because all this political drama, it’s like Nollywood, but with real consequences. We complain about the movie endings, but at least in Nollywood, we can rewind and watch again. This real-life version, we’re just stuck with the outcome. So, let's all pray that the sequel to this election no go be horror movie. Because honestly, I’m tired of watching the same script, just with different actors. And maybe, just maybe, next time, we’ll elect people who actually remember say they are supposed to serve the people, not just serve themselves. Abi, una agree?

(Chijioke bows slightly to applause, a mischievous glint in his eye)
God bless Nigeria… seriously. We need all the blessings we can get.
