(Chijioke Eze walks confidently onto the stage, adjusts the mic, and surveys the audience with a mischievous grin.)

"Ah, Nigeria! My people, my people! Una good afternoon o! Or good evening, depending on whether NEPA has decided to grace you with light today. If you have light, ehn, cherish it! Treat it like your first girlfriend – appreciate the small things, because e no go last!

So, I see all of una here, ready for some truth mixed with laughter, abi? Because in Nigeria, if you no laugh, you go cry. And crying hard in this economy? Ha! Tears are expensive these days. Even sorrow get price tag.

Let’s talk about our dear President Tinubu. Baba is working hard, they say. Meeting World Bank Chiefs in Abuja. Fine! Meeting is good. But me I want to know, after the meeting, did they offer us loan, or did we offer them jollof rice and small chops? Because knowing us, we fit don promise them all the oil in the Niger Delta, just for a photo-op!

And Atiku, bless his heart, is already shouting, "Tinubu obsessed with re-election, neglecting governance!" My brother, election don finish nah! Let the man breathe small. It’s like telling a marathon runner to start training for the next race immediately he crosses the finish line. Atiku, rest small nah. Maybe go chop Suya, relax. The 2027 election is still far, even though in Nigerian politics, far is closer than you think.

Speaking of 2027, Osun PDP don already adopt Tinubu as their sole candidate! Osun PDP! Wait, what? Is that like…is that like Real Madrid adopting Messi? E dey confuse me o! Maybe they know something we don’t know. Maybe they saw Tinubu do better "leg work" than even Portable. I don’t know o! Politicians and their ways, na wa! They will confuse you like a traffic warden giving directions in Lagos during rush hour.

And Kwankwaso is saying Tinubu is developing Southern Nigeria and abandoning the North. Kwankwaso! My brother, you wan start wahala again? Abeg, we don tire for tribalism. We all are suffering equally under this economy. The only difference is that some people are suffering in mansions, and some are suffering under the bridge. But suffering is suffering! Whether you dey chop indomie with egg or caviar, the pain of high prices touches everybody.

You know, sometimes I wonder if these politicians even remember what it's like to be a regular Nigerian. Do they remember queuing for fuel? Do they remember battling with conductors over change? Do they remember the joy of finding a fairly used okrika shirt that looks brand new?

Speaking of fuel, remember when Buhari removed fuel subsidy and told us it was for our own good? Ah! Katsina Governor now said Buhari told him something about Tinubu after the removal. Ah! These revelations that come after power has changed hands. Why couldn’t Buhari tell *us* directly? Now we are hearing gist second hand. Like hearing about your ex-girlfriend’s wedding from a mutual friend. The pain is different!

Buhari! I remember one time, I was driving in Lagos, and my car ran out of fuel. Completely dry. I was stranded on Ikorodu road, in the middle of traffic. Haa! The embarrassment! People were shouting, "Nigeria, which way?" Some were laughing. One guy even came to me and said, "Oga, this is what Buhari meant by change! Now you see change, abi?" I almost slapped him. But I didn't, because I didn't have the energy to fight. Fuel scarcity will humble you. It will make you question your existence. It will make you consider selling your car and buying okada.

And the worst part? I had a date that night! A very beautiful woman. I had promised her a romantic dinner. Instead, I was stranded on Ikorodu road, smelling of exhaust fumes and frustration. She eventually cancelled the date. Said she had a “family emergency”. Family emergency turned out to be dinner with another guy. I saw the pictures on Instagram the next day. Ah! Buhari and fuel subsidy nearly cost me a wife!

But that’s Nigeria for you. One minute you are planning a romantic dinner, the next minute you are pushing your car on Ikorodu road, smelling of exhaust fumes and heartbreak.

And talking about the economy, I saw a scorecard saying Buhari failed as President. Scorecard! Like we didn't know already! It’s like giving a doctor a failing grade after he accidentally removed your kidney instead of your appendix. Ehn? What were we expecting? A surprise A+?

But seriously, what is the solution? How do we fix Nigeria? How do we make sure that our leaders are accountable? How do we ensure that our economy works for everyone, not just a select few?

I don’t have all the answers, my people. If I did, I would be chilling in Dubai right now, sipping champagne on a yacht, instead of sweating on this stage in Lagos, trying to make you laugh.

But I do know one thing: we need to hold our leaders accountable. We need to demand transparency. We need to participate in the political process. We need to vote wisely.

And most importantly, we need to laugh. We need to laugh at the absurdity of it all. We need to laugh at the corruption, the incompetence, the tribalism. Because if we don't laugh, we will cry. And as I said before, tears are expensive these days.

So, let’s laugh together, my people. Let’s laugh at Nigeria. Let’s laugh at ourselves. And let’s pray that one day, we will have a Nigeria that is truly worth laughing *with*, not *at*.

Before I go, I want to give a shout out to all the Nigerian comedy skitmakers on TikTok. Una dey try! Una dey keep us sane in this mad country. Keep up the good work! Because honestly, sometimes, your skits are more informative than the actual news!

And finally, to President Tinubu, if you are watching this (which I doubt, because you are probably busy meeting with another World Bank Chief), abeg, just remember us, your people. Remember the suffering. Remember the promises you made. And remember that 2027 is closer than you think. Osun PDP might have adopted you, but the rest of us are still watching.

Thank you, my people! I love you all! And remember, if NEPA takes the light, just light a candle and find something to laugh about. Because in Nigeria, laughter is the best medicine. And these days, we need all the medicine we can get!

One love!" (Chijioke waves and exits the stage to applause.)
