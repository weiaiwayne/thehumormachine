(Chijioke Eze walks onto the stage, dressed in a sharp Ankara print shirt and dark jeans. He grabs the mic, a mischievous glint in his eye.)

Oyinbo say time is money. In Nigeria, time *is* money...for the politicians. Because the longer dem dey there, the more money dem fit *find*. Good evening, Lagos! Good evening, Nigeria! And a special good evening to all my people watching online – from London to Liberia, Naija no dey carry last!

How una dey? I trust say the hustle strong? Fuel price still dey dance shoki, eh? But we move! We must move, because if we no move, who go chop?

So, I see say our oga at the top, President Tinubu, don dey very busy. He dey meet World Bank chiefs for Abuja. World Bank chiefs! Na so dem dey come, smiling and promising heaven and earth. But last last, na loan dem go give us. Loan wey our grandchildren go still dey pay. Na circle o, my people, a vicious circle!

Dem say he dey developing Southern Nigeria. Kwankwaso talk am! And Kwankwaso no dey mince words. He just dey *kwankwaso* things straight. (Pause for laughter). But seriously, Kwankwaso said Tinubu abandoned the North. Abeg, is Nigeria now jigsaw puzzle, where you develop one piece and leave the rest? Wetin be dis? We need national development, no be sectional enjoyment!

And Atiku dey vex! Baba dey say Tinubu is obsessed with re-election and neglecting governance. Atiku, my brother, with all due respect, you just dey tell us what we already know. Is like telling us say pepper dey hot! We felt the heat since 2023 election wey never still finish for tribunal.

But wait oh, wait oh! The real comedy is this: Osun PDP don adopt President Tinubu as their sole 2027 presidential candidate! Osun PDP! The same PDP wey he defeated? Ah, Nigeria, I hail thee! This one pass Nollywood. This one pass even that TikTok comedy quiz wey dem dey do.

It’s like say dem don see something wey we no dey see. Abi dem don collect ‘settlement’? Because I no understand. To adopt your opponent as your candidate? That one na politics or witchcraft? (Pause for laughter and murmurs of agreement).

You know, sometimes I think Nigerian politics is like Suya. Plenty spice, plenty pepper, but at the end of the day, e still dey burn your mouth. You dey enjoy am, but you dey suffer am. And the people selling the Suya, na dem dey enjoy pass.

Speaking of enjoying, I saw a post about Gladys Emokpaire, the CEO of Bluorchid Aesthetics Clinic. She received the Africa's Under 40 CEO's Award. Congratulations to her! But honestly, when I see these awards, I just dey wonder who dey nominate these people. And who dey pay for the award? Because in Nigeria, anything is possible. Dem fit give you "Best Farmer of the Year" award even if you never plant okra before.

But back to Tinubu. He dey receive Segun Oni at Aso Rock. Segun Oni! The same Segun Oni wey used to be Governor of Ekiti State. Politics makes strange bedfellows, eh? Today you dey fight, tomorrow you dey chop jollof rice together. Na wa!

You know, Buhari sef don yarn. According to Katsina Governor, Buhari told him something about Tinubu after the fuel subsidy removal. Wetin Buhari talk? E say…e say…(leans into the mic conspiratorially) …I no go tell una! (Pause for laughter). You think say I want collect DSS invitation? Abeg, my mouth dey shut!

But seriously, this fuel subsidy removal, na wahala! My mechanic, Emeka, tell me say since dem remove subsidy, him customers don reduce. People no dey drive their cars again unless e urgent. Even runs girls dey trek now! (Wait for laughter). Economy hard, my people. Economy hard!

And the scorecard for Buhari’s administration? Key metrics show say e failed. Failed! Na so dem dey talk. But me, I no go talk too much. Because if you talk true for Nigeria, dem go say you dey hate. And I no want make anybody hate me. I just want make una laugh.

You see, I remember one time, I was driving in Lagos traffic, right? This danfo driver nearly scratched my car. I wound down my window to shout at him, but then I saw his face. The man looked so tired, so defeated. I just couldn't shout. I just sighed and said, "Oga, abeg, just dey careful."

That's Nigeria for you. We are resilient, we are forgiving, even when we have every reason to be angry. But that doesn't mean we should accept mediocrity. That doesn't mean we should tolerate corruption. That doesn't mean we should keep voting for the same people who keep disappointing us.

We need to demand better! We need to hold our leaders accountable. We need to stop celebrating small achievements and start demanding real progress. Because Nigeria deserves better. Our children deserve better. We all deserve better.

And speaking of deserving better, I heard say dem wan increase the salary of politicians again. Increase! When teachers never collect salary, when doctors dey strike, when ordinary citizens dey struggle to buy garri, dem wan increase salary! Ah, Nigeria! (Shakes head).

You know, I think Nigerian politicians are like that uncle wey always dey borrow money but never dey pay back. You see am coming, you dey hide your wallet. But somehow, e go still find you and collect something.

But the thing is, we, the citizens, we are the ones lending them the money. We are the ones voting them into power. So, we have to be smarter. We have to be more discerning. We have to stop falling for their sweet talk and empty promises.

We need to remember what Buhari told Katsina Governor… oh wait, I can't tell you that! (Callback to earlier joke. Pause for laughter). But seriously, we need to remember the lessons of the past. We need to learn from our mistakes. We need to build a better Nigeria, one vote at a time.

Because if we no do am, who go do am? If we no build am, who go build am? This is our country, my people. And we have to fight for it. We have to work for it. We have to laugh for it. Even when things are hard, we have to find the humor in it. Because if we no laugh, we go cry. And crying no dey solve problem. But laughter…laughter fit give us the strength to face another day.

So, let us laugh tonight. Let us forget our problems, even if it's just for a little while. Let us celebrate our resilience, our humor, our Naija spirit!

And remember, my people, vote wisely in 2027! Or maybe Osun PDP is onto something... adopting your opponent...wait, what? Maybe that's the real strategy! Confusion is a weapon! (Wait, what? moment. Pause for confused laughter).

Thank you, Lagos! You have been a wonderful audience! May God bless you all! And may God bless Nigeria! I'm Chijioke Eze, and I'm out!
(Chijioke bows and exits the stage to applause and cheers.)
