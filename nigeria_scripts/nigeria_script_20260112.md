Eh, my people, you ever notice how our politicians switch parties faster than a danfo driver changes lanes in Third Mainland traffic? Take this Bayelsa governor, Diri, the man was PDP through and through, solid like garri in hot water, then suddenly, poof, he's APC now. Na so life be for Naija politics, abi? One minute you're shouting "power to the people" in red colors, next thing you're waving green and white flags like nothing happened. I dey imagine him packing him bags, telling him wife, "Babe, we dey move house again, this time to the other side of the fence." And the followers? Dem just follow, no questions, because who wan stay behind when the bandwagon dey roll with free rice and goat meat? Shey you no see? It's like our jollof rice – everybody claims theirs is the best, but when hunger strike, you go chop any one wey dey hot.

That kind switch-up no be new sha, but e dey make me think of those old military days wey come back to haunt us. See President Tinubu sending birthday wishes to General Babangida, the man wey rule with iron fist back in the 80s, now 84 years strong. Happy birthday, IBB, may your cake no dey like our economy – dry and crumbling. But seriously, e sweet my heart say dem dey hail am, because e show say history no dey forget, even if e dey selective. Babangida with him annulment wahala, now getting shout-outs from the civilian boss. I dey wonder, if dem throw birthday party for Aso Rock, who go show? All the ex-heads of state, dancing azonto together? Imagine Buhari, Obasanjo, Jonathan, all toasting with Chapman, reminiscing on how dem scatter things back in the day. And Tinubu there, smiling, thinking, "My turn to fix wetin una leave." But e be like say the cake dem cut no reach everybody, because while dem dey celebrate longevity, the youth dey hustle for survival. God go help us, because even in the Bible, dem say wisdom come with age, but sometimes age just come alone, leaving wisdom to play catch-up.

Speaking of fixing things, let's talk this Lagos governor, Sanwo-Olu, wey dey beg foreign investors to come pour money into climate change projects. The man stand for one international forum, sounding all polished, "Lagos is ready for green energy, sustainable development, join us!" Meanwhile, back home, the state dey flood every rainy season like Noah's ark audition. You go dey dash through Ojota, water reach your knee, Okada man carrying you like passenger on lifeboat. And e dey appeal to global investors? Which kain investors go come build solar panels when NEPA still dey take light like thief in the night? I picture one oyinbo executive listening, nodding, then asking, "Governor, nice pitch, but how una go handle the traffic? Because if my Tesla no fit move for your roads, forget the deal." Sanwo-Olu probably reply, "No wahala, we go build flyovers... next year." But truth be say, Lagos na the most dangerous state, according to some reports – armed robbers, potholes, and now climate wahala on top. E be like say we dey invite people to come enjoy our chaos, rebranded as "vibrant urban living." Lord, give us grace to laugh through it, because if no be humor, person fit cry.

Now, that one lead me to the doctors' strike wey dey shake the whole country. Government finally move to end am, after months of patients suffering like Job in the Bible. You go rush go hospital, only to see sign: "No doctor today, try prayer warrior." And the negotiation? Dem siddon dey yarn, promising salary increase, better welfare, but e always end the same – partial payment, then strike resume. I dey feel for my sister wey be nurse in government hospital, she tell me say dem dey manage with paracetamol for everything, from headache to heartbreak. "Bro, even when patient dey complain of malaria, we go say 'Take this and believe,' because na faith we get plenty." But e no funny when people dey die for queue, waiting for ambulance wey no dey come. Economy tight, inflation biting harder than Lagos mosquito, yet doctors wan salary wey match the work. Government say "We dey try," but try no dey cure fever. Shey una see why we need that biblical redemption? Politicians promise heaven on earth, but only up there dem go deliver without strike notice.

And e no stop there, check this NNPC and that refinery deal wey dem dey talk to extend, paying in naira for crude oil. Sounds smart, right? Keep dollars out, strengthen our currency. But wait, who believe say e go work smooth? Last time dem try something like this, na scarcity follow, queues from Mile 2 to Badagry. Now, dem say "Naira-based supply," and I dey imagine the refinery owner scratching head, calculating if naira go hold value by next week. Because our money dey dance more than masquerade in festival – up today, down tomorrow. Everyday Nigerians, we dey feel am direct: go market, tomato price don jump again, like e get PhD in economics. Mama putu wey sell by roadside, she dey add extra akara just to make up. And unemployment? Government dey talk plans with USA, but plans no dey chop. Youths graduating, CV flying everywhere, only to end up driving Bolt or selling recharge card. E be like say the system dey set trap, and we dey run inside am with hope.

But here's the real gist, my brothers and sisters, this political circus with governors jumping ship, old generals getting props, and governors begging for green money while we drown in brown water – e all point to one thing: Naija resilience. We dey survive am all, with our pidgin wisdom and unshakeable spirit. Even when strike dey, we go find herbalist or pastor to sort. When flood come, we go build canoe from pure water nylon. And for that Trump noise wey dem summon diplomats over? Nah, we no go dwell, because our own wahala plenty pass. God dey watch, and as Ecclesiastes talk, there's time for everything – time to switch party, time to strike, time to laugh. So make we choose laughter today, because tomorrow, who knows? Maybe the naira go stabilize, or doctors go resume with full pay. But if no be, we go still dey here, cracking jokes, holding on to grace that never fails. After all, in Naija, if you no laugh, you go mad. And madness no dey pay bills. Peace out, my people – stay sharp, stay faithful.
