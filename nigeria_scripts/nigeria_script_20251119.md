Eh, my people, imagine dis one wey dey happen for our side, where dat Bayelsa oga at de top, e suddenly decide say e no wan stay with PDP again, e jump fence go APC side like say na better party wey get more jollof rice. Shey una see how dese politicians dey switch teams faster dan Okada rider wey dey dodge pothole? One day dem dey wear one color, next day dem change am to match de winning side, as if life na football match wey dem dey play for survival. And we, de ordinary citizens, we just dey watch from sideline, shaking head, wondering when our own turn go come to jump for better pasture. But e be like say for dem, loyalty na word from dictionary wey dem no dey read.

Now, think am, dis Bayelsa matter no be new thing, but e dey remind me how our leaders dey treat politics like market bargaining, where e go higher bidder dat wins de day. E dump PDP, join APC, and suddenly e be like hero wey don find redemption. Redemption? Abeg, if na Bible story, e for be prodigal son wey return home with fatted calf, but here e be more like prodigal politician wey return with empty promises and full pocket. And de followers? Dem dey hail am, clapping hands as if e don score goal for Champions League. Me, I dey ask, wetin go happen if tomorrow APC no dey sweet again? E go jump back or find new party wey dem dey form underground? Na so our system dey turn, circle of musical chairs where chair na power and music na election drumbeat.

Speaking from heart, dis kind switching no help anybody, especially we wey dey struggle daily with empty wallet and high price for garri. Politician switch, but our wahala remain same, e no change. E be like say dem dey play chess with our lives, moving pieces here and there, while we be pawns wey dey march forward hoping no to get captured. And in de midst of all dis, I remember dat verse wey talk say true change come from above, no be from party card. Even when leaders dey flip-flop, God's plan no dey change, e steady like rock. So maybe instead of jumping parties, dem suppose jump to prayer mat first, seek wisdom before dem scatter our peace.

Ah, now let me yarn una about dis other wahala wey dey make international noise, where dat American big man, Trump, wake up and talk say e fit send soldiers come our land over some threat. Ehn, wetin be dis? As if our small internal matter need foreign boot to step in and arrange am. And our own side, dem summon all diplomats for Abuja, dey respond with diplomatic talk, assuring say everything under control. Under control? Shey una dey hear? While dem dey talk peace on paper, we for street dey wonder if dis na movie script or real life drama. Trump dey tweet threat, our leaders dey call meeting, and me I dey think, why no just invite am come taste our suya first, maybe e go change mind.

You sabi how e be, foreigners dey look our politics like say na Nollywood film wey need sequel with action scene. But truth be say, we no need outside army to solve our matter, we get enough drama inside already. Doctors dey strike, hospitals empty, people wey need care dey wait, and government dey move to end am, promising salary and peace. E good sha, but e late small, abi? Why wait till strike hot before dem act? Na so e dey, crisis first, solution after. And in dat mix, Trump threat come add pepper, making everybody tense. But me, I laugh, because even in de storm, we Nigerians find way to survive, praying for grace dat calm de waters, just like dat story of Jesus on de sea.

Dis doctors strike matter, e touch everybody, especially we wey no fit afford private clinic. Imagine, you get fever, go hospital, but doctor no dey because dem dey fight for better pay. Na so life turn to survival game, where you swallow paracetamol and pray say e work miracle. Government say dem go end am, but how many times dem promise before? E be like endless loop, strike, negotiate, resume, repeat. And we patients, we be collateral, hoping dat one day, health care go be right without wahala. Shey una feel me? In de end, perhaps de real cure no be money alone, but heart wey care, and faith wey heal beyond medicine.

Now, shift gear small, hear dis one about our fuel import tariff, where government first impose 15 percent, then do U-turn, remove am sharp sharp. Wetin happen? Economy dey scream, importers dey complain, so dem reverse like car wey enter one-way by mistake. Na comedy gold, because one week dem say yes, next week no, leaving everybody confused like person wey enter wrong bus. And businesses? Dem suffer, price go up and down like yo-yo. Me, I dey wonder, if dem fit change mind so fast, why no change am for good things, like lower food cost or steady jobs? Politicians dey play ping-pong with policy, while we dey dodge de ball.

E no end there, Lagos State oga, Sanwo-Olu, dey appeal to global investors for climate change summit, talking green energy and investment. E sound fine, but in reality, we still dey battle flood every rainy season, potholes wey swallow tire, and heat wey no let person sleep. Investors come, promise billions, but where de money go land? Road? School? Or just more billboard? Na hope wey we hold, but with touch of skepticism, because promise plenty, delivery scarce. Yet, in dat appeal, e dey show say we dey try move forward, blending tradition with modern hustle, and trusting dat higher power go guide de path to better tomorrow.

And dat NNPC with Dangote refinery deal, extending crude supply in naira, no more dollar wahala. E be step forward, keeping money inside, but shey e go lower pump price? Or na just talk wey sweet ear? Time go tell, but for now, we celebrate small win, while eyeing de bigger picture. Life in our land full of twists, but we resilient, laughing through pain, holding to faith dat light dey at tunnel end.

Finally, tie am up, all dese news – party switch, foreign threats, strikes, policy flips, investor calls – dem show say our story na mix of chaos and hope. Politicians dey dance, we dey watch and pray, knowing dat true stability come from divine hand, no be human scheme. So next time wahala knock, remember, even in joke, grace dey sufficient. And if Trump still wan send army, tell am say we get our own warriors – prayer and perseverance. Dat one no dey fail.
