Ah, my people, good evening! Welcome, welcome to "Wahala Wednesday," because every day in Nigeria is just a prelude to Wednesday, right?

So, I don see wetin dey happen for this country, ehn? I see am well-well. You know, I went to yankee last month, right? Beautiful place, plenty light, roads smooth like baby skin. Then I landed back in Lagosâ€¦bam! Welcome back to reality. You see potholes wey fit swallow small car. I swear, I nearly lost my corolla in one. I say, "Jesus is Lord!" the mechanic say, "Na your shock absorber be the problem, bros, no need bring Jesus inside this one."

Speaking of Jesus, una see how Peter Obi dey form coalition upandan? E be like Avengers assembling for the final battle. I just dey wonder, if dem finally win, who go be Thanos? Maybe NEPA? Because honestly, that one is a supervillain of the highest order. You plug your phone to charge, you blink once, and light don go. You think say na small thing?

And una see this Supreme Court matter? Dem just dey confirm governors left, right, and center. E be like say dem dey share amala and ewedu for courtroom. Nobody dey vex? Nobody dey shout? We just dey look? We go just dey shout for Twitter, dey trend hashtag, then go sleep. Next morning, we go work again.

I been dey read Reddit, ehn. Dem dey argue about AI. AI this, AI that. My people, we still dey struggle with NEPA bringing steady light, dem dey talk about AI. Wait, what? I think say na joke o. But I saw the post. Wetin AI go do for us wey light no fit do? E go pay my school fees? E go clear Lagos traffic? Make dem leave AI alone, make we first solve problem wey dey ground.

Remember say Buhari don die? dem say e go build a better Nigeria, twice. Twice! E be like say dem give am two tries for JAMB. My mama dey always say, "once bitten, twice shy." But Buhari, e try twice. E still no pass. E be like say e just dey collect salary dey chop jollof rice. Kai!

And this thing wey them dey call "hypocrisy of the West," ehn? Abeg, who we dey blame again? Na Western leaders wey no build our roads or na we leaders wey dey thief the money wey dey suppose build am? Me, I no know o. I just dey ask question.

You know, I remember one time, I dey drive for Lekki-Epe expressway, and I see one big man, convoy full ground, dey drive against traffic. Me, I say, "Oga, wetin dey happen? You no know say this thing dey wrong?" The man just look me one kind eye, like say I be cockroach wey wan argue with elephant. I just park my car, I dey look am dey pass. Na Naija we dey, anything goes. Even driving against traffic. In fact, driving against traffic fit be national sport soon. Dem go dey give medals for am.

But honestly, my people, we go laugh, we go joke, but the thing dey pain us inside. This country, e get potential. E get people wey sabi. But the wahala too much. We need light, we need roads, we need leaders wey no dey thief. Simple.

But until then, make we dey laugh small. Because if we no laugh, we go cry. And crying no dey solve anything. Unless you wan cry for passport office. That one fit work. *wink* Thank you! You all have been a great audience. I will be here all week, try the fish!
