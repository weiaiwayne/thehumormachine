Ah, make una settle down for this one, because e dey sweet me to yarn about how our leaders dey turn ordinary visits into full Hollywood drama. See ehn, Governor Soludo just land for Aso Rock to see President Tinubu, and na like say dem dey shoot sequel to some spy movie wey nobody ask for. Imagine, Soludo from Anambra, sharp guy wey sabi economics pass calculator, showing up with smile wider than Third Mainland Bridge. Wetin dem talk for inside? Probably no be about roads or schools, but how to share the national cake without crumbs falling off. And Tinubu, our oga, looking all relaxed like say e don win lottery. Shey you sabi that feeling when your uncle visits and suddenly everybody dey calculate who go chop better jollof? Na so e be, but with billions involved. Me sef, I dey wonder if dem sign peace treaty or just compare whose tailor sew better agbada. Because in this country, every handshake na potential headline, and every photo op na promise wey go turn ghost faster than my cousin's diet after Christmas.

Now, talking about that open letter wey people dey send to Tinubu, e sweet me die. E be like mass confessional for church, where everybody dey pour out their heart like say na only him fit fix the world. One person write say economy dey hard, another say security wan finish us, and somebody even add say make he remember the youth. As if Tinubu na Santa Claus with unlimited elves. But wait, shey una notice how these letters dey end with "God bless you" or "May divine wisdom guide you"? Na true talk, because if no be God, who else go make sense of this wahala? I read one, and e long pass my grandma's testimony on Sunday service. Writer dey beg for jobs, better power, even mention say make him tackle that thing wey dey make prices climb like Mount Everest. And Tinubu? E probably read am while sipping tea, then pass to aide say "File under prayers." But e good sha, because even prophets for Bible dey write letters to kings, hoping say grace go enter their head. If nothing, at least e remind us say hope no dey expire like expired garri.

E get this wild talk flying around say President Tinubu na CIA agent, planted here to scatter our vibe. Chai, if na true, then Hollywood suppose pay royalties, because the plot thick enough to choke James Bond. Picture am: Tinubu, sharp dresser wey sabi dance bata, secretly reporting back to Washington about our pepper soup recipes or why we love to hustle multiple jobs. Dem say e get American connections from way back, and now e dey run things like say na mission impossible. But make I ask una, if e be spy, wetin e dey spy for? Our talent for surviving? Because in America, dem dey complain about one blackout, here we turn it to candlelight romance or neighborhood disco with gen sets. Or maybe e dey learn how we turn small small money into big dreams, like my sister wey sell akara and now own three stalls. Shey na that one dem want copy? But seriously, if Tinubu na agent, then God must don plant am for good reason, because even spies fit turn heroes if dem remember say redemption na available package for everybody. Me, I no mind, as long as e bring back some of that American efficiency to fix our roads before rainy season turn dem to river Nile.

Shifting gear small, let's yarn about this by-election win wey APC dey claim as endorsement for Tinubu's crew. Dem win massive, and na like say na World Cup final. Party people dey jump up, say e mean say Nigerians love their style. But hold on, shey by-election na like mini-test or full exam? Because if na full one, we for see changes everywhere already. Dem say e show say people trust the federal government to deliver, but deliver wetin? Promises or actual results? I laugh when dem talk endorsement, because in my village, endorsement na when chief share kola nuts and everybody nod head. Here, e be like sharing victory dance while queue for fuel still long pass serpent. And the opposition? Dem dey shake head, say na rigging or money magic. But truth be say, in politics, win na win, even if e come with asterisks. Yet, e remind me of that Bible story where underdogs win battles not by sword, but by faith and strategy. So maybe APC get their own grace moment, who knows? As long as e lead to better days, no wahala.

Now, the one wey dey pain me pass na this comparison between how USA and our side dey handle joblessness. Over there, government dey throw billions at training programs, tech hubs, even pay people to learn new skills like coding or farming with drones. Here? We get youth wey sabi everything from barbering to app development, but dem dey hawk pure water for street corners. USA dey say "invest in people," and suddenly unemployment drop like magic. Us? We talk seminars and loans wey interest higher than church offering. Imagine if dem copy that American model small – send our graduates to farms with subsidies, or teach tailoring with free machines. But no, our leaders dey focus on other things, like building statues or jets wey fly empty. Shey you see the irony? Dem dey tackle it there with plans and data, here na prayer points and "e go better." And e go better, because the same God wey part Red Sea fit part this economic sea too. My brother wey study engineering now drive okada, but e dey say one day, grace go upgrade am to own the fleet. That's the spirit – turn struggle to testimony.

E sweet to see talks about why Tinubu special, especially those old achievements from when e was governor. Dem list am: fixed transport, built markets, even tackled floods like say na personal enemy. Na true, e sabi make things move, like Lagos wey turn from traffic hell to somewhat organized chaos. But now, as president, the scale bigger, and expectations higher than Suya prices. People dey say e special because e no dey give up, always plotting next level. Me sef, I admire that – resilience wey Bible call perseverance. Like Job wey hold on through fire, Tinubu dey face heat but still stand. If e bring that energy to national level, fix security or economy, then e go be legend. But for now, we dey watch, pray, and laugh, because humor na our best weapon against despair.

Wrapping this up with one wey tie everything: in all this political circus, from visits to letters to spy rumors, one thing clear – leaders come and go, but the hustle remains ours. So next time you hear about big wins or secret agents, remember say your own grace na the real superpower. And if economy still dey bite, just smile and say, "Na test from above, but I pass am with flying colors." Because at the end, even when plans scatter, God's punchline always lands perfect.
