Eh, my people, you ever notice how these oga at the top dey switch sides faster than a market woman changing her wrapper when rain start? Take this Bayelsa matter now, the man wey dey run things there, e just wake up one day and decide say PDP no longer sweet am, so e jump fence go APC side. Chai, na wa o. Imagine you dey your party uniform, marching with your mates, then suddenly you hear whistle and you run join the other team mid-game. Wetin happen? Did dem offer am better jollof or what? No be small thing, e go make you wonder if loyalty na something wey dem sell for five hundred naira for street corner. And the APC people, dem dey hail am like e just score winning goal for World Cup. Neutrality my foot, e be like say everybody wan chop from the same pot, even if the soup don finish.

That one wey follow am, this talk of climate change wey the Lagos oga, Sanwo-Olu, dey push to foreign investors. Ehn, my brother, e say make una come invest, say we get big plans for green energy and all that jazz. But wait first, you sabi how our roads dey turn to river every rainy season? Or how dem dey promise solar panels but up till now, we still dey pray for light wey no go flicker like candle for wind. E be like say e dey appeal to these oyinbo people say, come save us from our own wahala, even though dem get their own problems with snow and hurricanes. Me, I dey think, if climate change na the enemy, why our politicians no start by fixing the potholes wey swallow cars whole? Abi, shey na only when foreign money dey involved dem remember say earth dey hot? But you know, in the Bible, dem talk say even in the midst of storm, there go be calm, so maybe one day these investors go bring that peace, or at least fix the drainage so water no go enter my slippers again.

Now, let me yarn una about this doctors' strike wey dem finally wan end. Resident doctors, dem fold hand for months, say salary no reach, equipment no dey, patient dey suffer. Then suddenly, the big people say okay, we go talk, we go settle. Haba, wetin take hold una so? Na when the wahala don scatter everywhere, hospitals empty like ghost town, dem remember say health na wealth? Imagine you dey queue for pharmacy, praying say your headache no turn to something worse, and the doctor no show because e dey vex for pocket. Na so e be, we dey run from one clinic to another, begging for mercy, while dem up there dey argue over who go share the cake. But e good to see say dem dey move to end am, maybe now we fit breathe without fear of one small cough turning to big drama. And truly, as dem talk in scriptures, the Lord is our healer, so even when human hands dey shake, His grace dey cover the rest. Without that, who go trust these hospitals wey look like old market sheds?

Speaking of things wey dey turn around quick-quick, hear this U-turn on that fifteen percent tariff for fuel imports. One day dem announce say e go happen, next thing you hear, dem change mind, say no more. Chai, policy na like Lagos danfo driver – e go swerve left, swerve right, make you hold your heart. Why? Because the pressure from importers and all those big boys wey dey control the flow, dem no wan small increase spoil their business. So, government flip like okada rider avoiding pothole. Me, I dey laugh, because if dem fit change mind that fast, why no use that speed to fix unemployment wey dey bite everybody? Young boys and girls, dem graduate with degree, but job no dey, so dem turn to 419 or small-small hustle for street. Family dey pressure, papa say go find work, mama say pray, but reality hit hard like okada horn for your ear. And the Igbos for Lagos, dem dey complain say one Nigeria na dream, projects everywhere favor one side, like say the map na puzzle wey dem forget some pieces. Is the man in charge ruling the whole country or just his backyard? E dey make you shake head.

But wait, let me tell una story from my village days, back when I small, my uncle wey dey claim big politician, e promise say if e win, road go tar, school go build, even church go get new bell. Election come, e lose, but next time e switch party, same promises. Now, e dey there, road still red like laterite, school roof leak, but e get new car. Na so e be, we dey clap for promises like say dem na magic, but when e time to deliver, na only hot air. And the market women, dem suffer pass – price of yam go up, tomato spoil before sell, yet dem smile and pray. You know how we Nigerians do, even in the thick of it, we find way to laugh, to dance at owambe, to share small garri and call am feast. That's our spirit, unkillable, like cockroach wey survive anything.

Now, this matter of coexistence wey Sanwo-Olu talk, say Nigeria dey challenged, like say we no fit live together without fight. Ehn, true talk, from North to South, we get our differences, but wetin bind us na the same struggle – hunger, hustle, hope. Igbos build business for every corner, Yorubas control the flow, Hausas bring the cattle, but when election time come, na fight. Or this allegation of lopsided projects, say money dey pour to one place, others dey dry like harmattan skin. Me, I dey ask, if na so, why no share the wealth like communion bread, small for everybody? Because in church, dem teach say give to the poor, but politicians seem to forget that part. Maybe dem need revival, or at least a good sermon on fairness.

And don't get me start on this Japan and Brazil trip wey the top man do, departing for talks, but while e dey away, we here dey manage. Foreign diplomats summoned over threats from America, but assurance say diplomacy go handle. E be like Nollywood film – suspense, plot twist, but no happy ending yet. Bayelsa switch, APC hail, all in one week. My head dey spin. But you see, through it all, we hold on to faith, because politicians come and go, but the one wey never fails dey watch. Even when plans flip, His word no dey change.

Finally, imagine if these oga learn from the Good Book, treat people with justice, not just when camera dey roll. Then, maybe our country go shine, no more mirage, but real oasis. Until then, we go keep hustling, laughing, and praying. God bless una, and may your pocket never empty!
