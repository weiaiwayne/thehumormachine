Oya, gather round, gather round! Drinks for everyone… except that guy at the back looking suspicious. You look like EFCC come to check if we dey wash money.

So, how far Nigeria? Still Nigeria-ing, I see. The land of 200 million CEOs and zero light. I saw on Reddit the other day, Nigeria *tops* the global list for lack of electricity access. Tops! We are number one! In darkness. We should get a plaque. Maybe we can charge it with NEPA… oh, wait.

Tinubu dey try, I give am that. “Economic reforms,” they call am. I call am “economic… *something*.” My pocket is reforming alright. Reforming to empty! He dey promise plenty things, but promises in Naija are like keke drivers… dem full, but dem no dey reach your destination direct.

And speaking of reaching destinations… this rental property wahala ehn? I saw one person on Reddit complaining dem ask am tribe before dem show am house for Lagos! Lagos! The most cosmopolitan city south of… well, I can’t think of anywhere more cosmopolitan right now, abeg. Even my village people no dey ask tribe again before dem share yam. Only Lagos landlord. Na wa.

But the worst part? The gym! You know, where you go to sweat out the stress of being Nigerian? Dem evict people mid-workout! Equipments throwing everywhere! Only in Nigeria will you be trying to better yourself, and the country will actively try to stop you. It's like NEPA cutting light just as you put your Indomie on the gas.

And Nairaland, ehn? I saw one joke about Buhari… I won't even repeat it. Let the past rest. But one thing I learn from those jokes, we know how to laugh through the pain. We’ve become masters of comedic coping.

I was talking to my uncle the other day, you know, the one who always says “Nigeria is a sleeping giant?” I told him, “Uncle, that giant don dey snore so loud, we can’t hear anything else! And the giant dey sleepwalk straight into a pothole!”

And this student expulsion case? Two students, same offense, different religions, only one gets the boot? Chai! Wait, what? This one pass my power to joke about. This one is just… depressing. Even Teni and Ayra Starr can’t sing away that kind of injustice. And those two are *everywhere* now. Especially Ayra Starr. Some people say dem dey push her. Maybe dem should push her to fix the electricity issue, she seems to be getting things done.

But seriously, we need to wake up. We need to stop letting tribalism, religious bias, and bad governance steal our joy. We need to hold these politicians accountable. Because if we don't, who will? My uncle the sleeping giant?

So, next time you see a politician promising you heaven and earth, remember the keke driver. Remember the Lagos landlord. Remember the evicted gym-goers. And remember, Nigeria may be a comedy of errors, but we, the audience, deserve a better show. Now, who wants another drink? This round, I’m paying… if my account hasn't been reformed to zero.
