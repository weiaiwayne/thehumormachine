Eh, my brothers and sisters, imagine waking up to hear that some oga from America dey talk say him go send soldiers come scatter our peace here, like say we dey run some kind of backyard barbecue wey no invite am. President Trump, that man wey dey like lion for Twitter, now threatening military action, and our own president summoning every diplomat for town meeting, e be like town hall for ants wey gather to discuss elephant problem. Wetin dey happen? Is it because of those border wahala or what? Shey na because we no dey pay enough for their movies or something? I mean, the response come quick, assuring say diplomatic talks dey go on, but me I dey think, if soldier land, who go fight? Our boys wey dey do parade for independence day? Or those ones wey dey chase goat for village?

That one pass, now see this other matter. Former military head, General Babangida, clock 84 years, and the top man dey congratulate am with full praise, like say na birthday card from heaven. Ibb, the man wey rule with iron hand back then, now getting shoutout, e be like reuniting old classmates wey one time dey share coup plot notes. At 84, e still dey sharp, but the congratulation sound so sweet, almost like say, "Oga, happy birthday, no worry, we no dey hold grudge for those step-on days." Me I dey wonder, if na me turn 84 after plenty drama, who go send me card? My neighbor wey I borrow money from? Or the bank wey dey chase me for loan? But seriously, e show say time dey heal, even for power people, abi? Like biblical prodigal son returning, but instead of fatted calf, na national address.

Speaking of switching sides faster than chameleon for dry season, check Bayelsa governor wey dump PDP and run join APC, like say na new club wey get better jollof rice. The man wey suppose stay loyal like glue suddenly jump fence, e be like political musical chairs where the music stop and you grab any seat wey dey empty. Why now? Is it the wind wey dey blow or the pocket wey dey call? In Naija politics, loyalty be like market woman bargaining, today you with this side, tomorrow that one, as long as the offer sweet. But the people wey dey watch, dem dey shake head, say e too much. Imagine if life be like that: you wake up, dump your job for better pay, no notice, no wahala. But for politics, e dey happen every day, and we dey clap or curse depending on which team we support. Shey no be the same people wey dey promise heaven on earth, only to deliver potholes?

Now, shift gear to health front. Resident doctors dey strike again, and the powers that be dey move to end am, like say na fire wey dem dey fetch water for. These doctors, our lifesavers, folding arms because salary no reach, equipment scarce, like say hospital be museum exhibit. The negotiation dey go on, but me I dey imagine the scene: minister sit down with union, promising raise, while patient outside dey wait like queue for bread during scarcity. Wetin be the real cure? No be just talk, but action wey show say health no be luxury for rich man. In this country, where malaria fit turn to emergency, strike mean life on hold, and families dey pray extra hard. But remember, even in such mess, there's that grace wey carry us through, like how Jesus heal the sick without billing, no strike, no delay. If politicians learn small from that, maybe doctor no go need fold hand.

That remind me of another angle, this climate change talk from the Lagos state helmsman, Sanwo-Olu, appealing to global investors during some international summit. E dey talk say come invest, we get opportunity, but forget say our own rain dey fall like judgment day sometimes, flooding everywhere. He dey renew appeal, painting picture of green future, but on ground, market woman still dey bail water from shop during downpour. Investors dey listen, but dem dey calculate risk: is it worth shipping money come place where road go wash away next season? E be like selling umbrella during sunshine, promising storm later. And the people? Dem dey hope say investment mean jobs, not just photo op. Unemployment dey bite hard, youth wey graduate dey hawk pure water instead of resume. But in the midst of it, we hold to that faith wey say, even if world dey heat up, God's plan no dey change, like eternal cool breeze for hot afternoon.

Now, let's not forget the neutrality play in Anambra matter. The APC for that zone hailing the center for staying neutral, like referee wey no blow foul for own team. Election time, everybody dey watch if bias go show, but dem say e neutral, so praise dey fly. But neutral how? When power balance dey tilt like scale with heavy pocket? In politics here, neutrality be like virgin for brothel, hard to believe but we pretend. The opposition dey grumble, supporters dey celebrate, and common man dey ask, what e chop for me? At the end, vote count, but the real winner be the one wey control the narrative. Shey you see how e dey twist? Like story from old testament, where king pretend fair but heart dey scheme.

And oh, that meeting with World Bank chiefs, top man sit down with dem for talks, probably on loans and reforms. Dem dey discuss how to fix economy, but from outside, e look like bargaining for soul, with conditions wey choke. IMF sef, earlier talk say unrealistic to fix everything in two years, and reply come sharp, defending say we dey try. But try how, when youth dey jobless, turning talent to survival hustle? One time, my cousin graduate with engineering paper, now him dey fix Okada for street, dreaming of better. E pain, but we laugh to survive, because cry no pay bill. And in that laughter, we find redemption, like how David dance before ark, turning sorrow to joy.

See this lopsided project talk too, people dey murmur say some developments favor one zone over others, like say presidency be for particular backyard. Is it true or envy? But the question dey hang: one nation or divided favor? Coexistence challenged, as another voice put am, with Sanwo-Olu touching on it, saying we need unity. But unity how, when tribe pull different ways? Igbos for certain places dey feel sidelined, calling one country mirage, like desert vision wey no quench thirst. E heavy, but we weave through with humor, because anger no build bridge. Imagine if we apply biblical wisdom, love neighbor as self, no matter tribe, then maybe mirage turn oasis.

Even that drummer confession, one man spill how life as musician be, beating rhythm for survival, from church to club. E capture the Nigerian spirit, turning hardship to beat, like how we dance during trial. And the condition general, wey everybody feel, from market haggling to family gathering where uncle dey boast achievement wey no show. Foods ranking sef, people dey debate which chop best, but forget say empty pocket no rank anything. President jetting to Japan and Brazil, seeking partnership, but while him away, we dey manage here, hoping say deal sweet.

On the foreign threat again, Trump talk military, but our side dey engage, summoning envoys like family meeting for village. E funny how big powers play chess with us as pawn, but we no dey shake, because resilience be our middle name. And for doctors, end strike mean back to work, but pray say no repeat soon. At 84, Babangida get props, showing age no kill respect. Bayelsa switch, politics as usual. Neutrality in Anambra, watch and see. Climate appeal, let investment flow. World Bank chat, may e bring good. Lopsided, balance am. Coexistence, build am. Drummer beat, keep going. Condition tough, but faith lift.

In end, we dey here, laughing through the storm, because only Jesus promise no fail, and him delivery no need diplomat or investor. That na the real neutrality, the true switch to better side.
