Ah, my people, make una hold una belle make e no pain una as I yarn this one. You see this matter wey dey hot pass pepper soup for harmattan season, the way our oga at the top, Tinubu, dey play neutral for Anambra own like referee wey no wan take side. APC for Lagos dem dey hail am, say e good, e fine, but wait first, who e dey fool? Neutral how? When e be like say him eye dey wander go every corner, watching everybody like hawk wey dey eye chicken. Shey na neutrality or na him way of saying, make una sort una wahala, I dey watch from my AC room? Imagine if referee for World Cup talk say him neutral, next thing na red card fly everywhere, no whistle. And dem dey clap for am? Chai, na only for our side e fit happen, where praise singer turn critic overnight.

That aside, e get this other twist wey make person scratch head like say juju enter brain. Bayelsa own, the governor there don jump ship from PDP go APC, like say e wake up one morning decide say blue no fine again, make I wear yellow. Wetin happen? Na promise of better tomorrow or na fear of tomorrow wey no dey smile? E be like say politics na market where everybody dey change stall depending on which one dey sell pass. One day na opposition, next day na ruling party, tomorrow who knows, maybe e go form him own party called "PDAPC" join-join. And the followers? Dem dey follow like goat wey see green grass, no question, no wahala. But deep down, e dey make you wonder, if captain dey jump boat, wetin passengers go do? Swim abi? Or wait for life jacket wey no dey?

Ehn, speaking on jumping, make I carry una go another angle before una tire. This Babangida own, former military boss turn elder statesman, clock 84, and Tinubu send him congratulation like birthday card from primary school friend. 84 years ehn, that na plenty time to see wahala come and go, from coup to civilian rule, from oil boom to this our current squeeze. But wait, congratulation for wetin exactly? For surviving or for the stories wey e fit yarn now? Imagine sitting with am, asking, "Oga, wetin you see for those days?" Him go probably say, "My son, power na like hot akara, e burn if you no handle am well." And Tinubu dey nod, say yes sir, I dey learn. But truth be say, at 84, e suppose dey rest, dey tell history to grandchildren, not receive note from current tenant for Aso Rock. Shey e no tire? Or na our way, where old soldiers no dey fade away, dem just dey collect salute.

Now, let me twist am small to this diplomatic drama wey dey play like Yankee film. Trump over there, the one wey dey talk loud pass megaphone, don open mouth threaten military action, and next thing, our government summon all foreign diplomats for Abuja. Summon how? Like headmaster call bad students? Dem gather for one room, say look, wetin be this your oga story? We no send for war, we dey mind our business here with our own plenty load. And Tinubu respond, say no shaking, we dey talk diplomacy, everything go calm. But my brother, diplomacy na sweet word for "make we beg small." Imagine if na true, soldiers from across water land for our shore, wetin go happen? Dem go meet traffic wey worse pass battlefield, or dem go learn say bullet no fit stop okada rider. But seriously, why threat sef? Over wetin? Our matter no concern una, go face una own wall una build. E be like say world don turn to one big family meeting where uncle from America dey shout, and we dey pacify am with "sorry sir, next time."

And e no stop there, this doctors strike own dey add pepper to injury. Government dey move to end am, but how many times we don hear that one? Doctors fold arm, say no pay no work, patients dey suffer, and negotiation dey drag like snail race. Wetin be the hold up? Money wey no dey or pride wey plenty? Imagine going hospital, doctor say strike, so make you pray for healing. Na there e pain pass, because health no dey wait for policy. But our leaders dey try, abi? Or na another promise wey go turn vapor. Shey you fit imagine if Jesus dey for this time, him go heal with one word, no need for stethoscope or strike notice. That na the grace wey no dey strike, e dey work 24/7, no holiday.

E get this Sanwo-Olu matter too, Lagos governor dey appeal to global investors for this climate change summit, say come, invest, we get plan. Plan for wetin? For rain wey no dey stop or heat wey dey cook person alive? Him dey talk international, but back home, market woman dey ask, wetin concern me with climate when my tomato dey rot for flood? Investors go come, build fancy thing, but who go feel am? The big man or the okada boy wey dey dodge pothole? E be like say e dey sell dream wey no fit reality yet. And the crowd dey listen, nod head, but inside mind, dem dey think, "Oga, fix road first before you invite billionaire." That's our life, plenty talk, small action, but hope dey, because even when plan fail, faith dey carry person go.

Now, let me yarn una about this NNPC and Dangote refinery deal, extending crude supply with naira, no more dollar wahala. Sound good, abi? Like say we finally catch sense, use our own money for our own oil. But wait, e go work? Or na another layer of 419 where paper sign, but pump no dey flow? Imagine refinery wey suppose turn gold, but end up like white elephant, eating money without spitting product. And the people? Dem dey wait for cheaper fuel, but e be like say promise na like mirage for desert, you see am, but when you reach, nothing. Yet, e dey make sense, why we go dey owe foreign money when we get black gold underground? Shey na step forward or na dance around the issue? Only time go tell, but in the meantime, we dey pray, say make e work, because redemption no dey come cheap, e dey take faith and little sense.

Ah, and this Igbos in Lagos talk, one Nigeria as mirage, e dey hot for mind. People dey say lopsided projects, Tinubu dey favor one side, shey e be president for whole or just part? Wetin be this division wey no dey end? Like say family gathering turn to fight over jollof who cook am. But truth, we all dey in same boat, leaking everywhere, so why fight? Make we patch am together, with grace wey bind, not rope wey divide. Even Bible talk say unity na strength, lion no fit scatter flock wey stand firm. So, politicians, make una hear, stop the bias game, play fair, or na God go judge the score.

Finally, this extraordinary Nigerian teen story wey dey trend, one small boy doing big thing, making wave global. E inspire, abi? In middle of all this madness, youth dey show say future bright, not dark. No be by power or might, but by spirit wey dey move mountain. So, to all una, hold that hope, laugh through the pain, because tomorrow go better, if we no give up. And if politician promise heaven, remember, only one deliver am for real – no campaign poster attach. Peace out, my people, grace plenty!
