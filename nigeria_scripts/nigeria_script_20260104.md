Eh, my people, wetin dey happen for this our country sef? You see this Donald Trump wey dey over there for America, suddenly decide say him go threaten us with military action, like say Naija be him backyard wey him fit just invade anytime. Him wake up one morning, tweet something wild, and next thing, our government don summon all foreign diplomats to Abuja. Imagine the wahala, all these oyinbo ambassadors dey line up like queue for bank, sweating under Naija sun, while Tinubu people dey assure dem say everything na diplomacy. Diplomacy? Abeg, if na true war, e go be like one of those old war films where the hero talks too much before the bullets fly. But shey you blame am? With all the plenty plenty problems we get here, from doctors wey dey strike because salary no dey pay, to this Bayelsa governor wey just dump PDP go join APC like say na new jollof recipe him discover.

That governor, ehn, one day him dey shout PDP till him voice hoarse, next day, him don cross carpet faster than danfo driver wey see police checkpoint. E be like say APC get some kind of magic potion wey dey turn opposition people to allies overnight. Now, everybody dey wonder, who go be next? Maybe that uncle wey dey argue politics for family meeting, tomorrow him go switch side because "e better pass." And Tinubu, our oga at the top, dey congratulate former military president Babangida on him 84th birthday, sending sweet words like "happy birthday, general, may God continue to bless you with wisdom and health." Wisdom? Ehn, if IBB get wisdom, why him no use am teach these current leaders how to fix this economy wey dey choke person like tight agbada? But na so life be, even generals dey get old, and we still dey hail dem as if dem no dey tire.

Speaking of hailing, Lagos APC dey praise Tinubu for him neutrality in that Anambra matter, like say him sit down for middle, no favor anybody, pure referee. Neutrality? In Naija politics? That one na miracle, bigger than manna from heaven. Because usually, neutrality mean say you dey wait to see who win before you choose side, abi? But Tinubu dey play am cool, assuring everybody say him government dey handle things with kid gloves. Meanwhile, over there for Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu dey make appeal to global investors about climate change, talking of international something-something at some fancy event. Climate change in Lagos? My brother, before we worry about global warming, make we first solve this our local heat wey dey come from NEPA every evening. Him dey yarn to these investors say Lagos ready for green energy, sustainable this and that, but truth be say, the only green wey we dey see here na dollar wey hard to catch, or that one grass wey grow for roadside after rain.

You know how e be, Sanwo-Olu dey pose with smile, microphone in hand, telling world say we get plans for cleaner future, but back home, people dey hustle under that same sun, dodging potholes wey look like craters from meteor. E be like say him dey preach to choir wey no dey listen, because investors wan hear about profit, not our daily survival. And while him dey do that, Tinubu over there dey respond to Trump's threat, saying na all diplomatic channels, no panic. Diplomatic channels? In 2026? With phones and emails everywhere, why channels still dey block like Lagos go-slow? But e sweet me say our president no dey shake, him stand firm, assuring Nigerians say peace na the way. Peace, ehn, that one wey Bible talk about, the kind wey pass understanding? Because if Trump carry through with that threat, e go be like Goliath coming for David, but this time, David get prayer warriors and jollof as weapon.

Now, let me yarn una about this NNPC and Dangote refinery deal wey dey make small noise. Dem dey talk of extending naira-based crude supply, like say finally, we go use our own money to buy our own oil, no more dollar wahala. Sound good on paper, abi? But in Naija, good on paper mean say e fit turn to another 419 before e land. Imagine, refinery wey suppose save us from importing fuel, now dey negotiate like market women haggling over tomatoes. Dangote, that business titan, dey shake hands with NNPC bosses, promising more local deals, but shey e go reach the common man? Or e go just mean say big boys dey chop more, while we dey queue for black market. E be like that parable of talents wey Jesus yarn, where the wise servant invest and multiply, but here, e seem say the talents dey hide under mattress, waiting for rainy day wey never end.

And talking of economy, this whole Trump drama dey remind me of how we dey always beg for foreign help, like prodigal son returning home. But instead of fatted calf, we get threats and summits. Tinubu dey meet World Bank chiefs in Abuja, probably yarn about loans and reforms, but reforms in Naija mean say price go rise first before anything better. Unemployment still dey bite hard, young people wey graduate with degrees dey drive okada or sell recharge cards, dreaming of that American visa wey Trump now wan block. Shey you see the irony? The same man wey dey threaten us na the one wey plenty of us wan run go him country for greener pastures. But as Christians, we know say true green pasture na the one Psalm 23 talk about, where God lead us, no matter the threats from outside.

E get this one time, I dey think about how politicians promise heaven on earth, but only end up delivering potholes and higher bills. Like this doctors' strike wey government dey move to end, finally. Doctors wey dey save lives, but no salary to even buy stethoscope. Government say dem dey negotiate, but negotiation in Naija be like wrestling match where one side always pin the other. Yet, in all this, we dey find grace to laugh, because if we no laugh, the wahala go swallow us. Even when light go off and generator refuse to start, we remember say God's light never dim, him power steady like eternal battery.

But wait, here's the real gist: with Bayelsa governor switching parties, and all these diplomatic dances, one thing clear—Naija politics na like Nollywood sequel, same actors, different costume, but plot still dey twist. Tinubu dey congratulate IBB, Sanwo-Olu dey charm investors, NNPC dey deal with Dangote, and Trump dey bark from afar. Through it all, we Nigerians dey survive with wit and prayer, turning threats to jokes, strikes to songs. Because at the end, no matter the military talk or party jumps, the only invasion wey matter na the one of hope wey come from above. And if Trump try anything, make him know say we get Joshua's army, with trumpets wey fit bring down walls. Na so, my people—walls go fall, but our spirit no go break.
