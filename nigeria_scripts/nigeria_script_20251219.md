Wetin dey happen for this our country sef, e be like say even the big oga from across the ocean don decide to join the drama. You hear am? President Trump, the one wey dey talk plenty, now dey threaten to send soldiers come here, as if say we get some hidden treasure wey him eye don catch. Imagine, him siddon for him office, sip him coffee, and think say Nigeria na backyard wey him fit stroll into anytime. And our leaders? Dem summon all the foreign ambassadors go Abuja, like say na emergency family meeting. I laugh sha, because if na true war, e go be the first time say bullet go fly faster than our economy dey crash. But on the serious side, e show say even outsiders dey see the wahala wey we dey face daily, yet dem still wan add their own spice.

Now, shift gear small. Former military head, General Babangida, don clock 84, and President Tinubu send am birthday wishes, full praise and all. E sweet die, abi? The man wey once hold power with iron fist, now dey receive love letters from the current captain. Picture am: Babangida, sharp as ever, reading that message, maybe smiling to himself, thinking, "Ah, yesterday na coup plot, today na cake and candles." E dey remind me say in this life, people fit change uniforms, but the game remain the same. We Nigerians, we don see plenty of such twists – from barracks to boardrooms, everybody dey find way to stay relevant. And as Christians, wey believe in second chances, e fit be say even old soldiers get grace to enjoy their sunset years without alarm clocks from past battles.

That one take me to another angle: our Lagos State helmsman, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, dey make appeal to global investors about climate change. Him talk say Lagos wan join the world in fighting environmental wahala, inviting money from everywhere to build green future. E sound good on paper, shey? But come Lagos market, you go see plastic bags flying like confetti, generators roaring louder than thunder, and floods turning streets to rivers every rainy season. Investors go come, see the hustle, and ask, "Where make I put my billions when danfo buses dey block road like permanent traffic?" Sanwo-Olu dey try paint picture of eco-friendly city, but reality na say we still dey battle basic survival – from hawkers dodging rain to families sharing one umbrella under downpour. E be like say climate change na the new excuse for why things no dey work, yet deep down, we know say God's creation no spoil overnight; na our own choices dey add pepper to the stew.

Speaking of stews and survival, let's yarn about this deal between NNPC and Dangote refinery. Dem dey talk to extend supply of crude oil using naira, no more dollar wahala. Ah, this one na big news, because Dangote, the cement king turned oil baron, don build refinery wey suppose end our import madness. Imagine, finally, local crude going to local machine, paying with our own currency – e fit mean cheaper fuel, less queue for black market. But wait, Nigerians know say nothing dey straightforward. Yesterday, dem announce extension, today, we go hear pipe burst or contract review. E dey like those promises from pulpits: sound holy, but execution na test of faith. We pray say this one go deliver, because if e work, e go be miracle bigger than parting Red Sea – turning our oil curse to blessing, putting food on tables without begging from abroad.

You see, in all this political jumble, e easy to lose hope, but that's where our faith steps in quiet. Even when threats from outside or inside dey fly, we remember say higher power dey watch, turning chaos to testimony. Take the Bayelsa chief wey jump from PDP to APC – e be like musical chairs for power seats. One minute red flag, next yellow, and everybody dey clap as if na promotion. E show say loyalty na flexible thing here, but in God's book, true allegiance no change with wind. We laugh at the flip-flops, but e teach us say human plans fit scatter, yet divine ones stand firm.

Now, expand on that climate appeal small. Sanwo-Olu dey host international talk, shining lights on sustainable development, but back home, the average trader dey wonder if solar panel go charge him phone faster than the sun sets on unpaid bills. Global investors, dem love the buzzwords – carbon footprint, renewable energy – but when dem land, dem go face the real footprint: potholes big as craters, air thick with exhaust from okadas weaving through chaos. E be irony wey fit make angel laugh: begging for green funds while brown envelopes still rule the day. And us? We adapt, as always – turning floodwater to swimming pool, or generator smoke to barbecue flavor. Faith keeps us going, whispering that even in storm, rainbow dey follow.

Back to the Trump saga, because e no fit end without punch. Him threaten military action, maybe over some trade dispute or election noise, but our response na diplomatic dance. Tinubu assure say dem dey talk, no panic. E sweet, seeing African giant no dey shake easily. But imagine if soldiers truly march in – dem go meet boys wey sabi juju more than gunpowder, turning invasion to Nollywood script. We no need foreign boots; our own boots from daily grind don toughen us. And in the Bible, David face Goliath with stone, no army – so maybe we no need counter-threat; just prayer and pidgin negotiation go sort am.

On Babangida's milestone, e no just birthday; e reflection on time. At 84, him still sharp, maybe sharper than some young ministers. Tinubu's congrats bridge eras, from military decrees to civilian vibes. E make you think: what if we apply that wisdom to current crises? Instead of jumping parties like Bayelsa boss, stay put and fix the roof before rain. But nah, politics na theater, and we the audience, paying with taxes and patience.

Finally, that Dangote deal – if e extend smooth, e go ripple through economy like revival wave. No more dollar chase for crude; naira go flex muscle. Families go breathe easier, unemployment lines shorten, poverty no go bite as hard. But we Nigerians, we sabi wait-and-see: promise land flowing with milk and honey, but first, cross the wilderness. Faith say hold on; humor say laugh through the thorns. So, as 2025 wrap up, with all this mix of threats, birthdays, appeals, and deals, one thing clear: Nigeria no dey carry last. We rise, we roast the absurd, and we trust the One wey never flips sides. Peace out, my people – tomorrow na another script.
