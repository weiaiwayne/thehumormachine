My brothers and sisters, gather round this invisible fire wey I dey kindle with words, because e get this one matter wey don turn our political landscape into something resembling a Nollywood plot twist, where yesterday's enemy becomes today's best friend overnight. You sabi that Bayelsa governor, the one wey decide to jump ship from PDP straight into APC arms, e be like say him see better pasture or perhaps the grass look greener on the other side after tasting the PDP bitter leaf soup too long. Imagine, one day you dey wear red cap, next morning you don switch to broom, sweeping away old loyalties faster than a market woman clears her stall before rain fall. E no be the first time, oh, but this one sweet me die, because now APC get more members than a popular church on harvest day. And me I dey wonder, if politicians fit change parties like we change SIM cards for better network, why una no dey change banks when ATM dey swallow card? At least with bank, you fit get refund, but with politics, the only refund na promise wey never materialize.

Now, speaking of promises that shine brighter than fool's gold, let's talk about this our president wey go ahead congratulate former military head, Babangida, on him 84th birthday. Ah, 84 years, that's age wey suppose come with wisdom like old palm wine, sweet and full of stories. But wait first, Tinubu send him goodwill message, calling am elder statesman, and I dey think, elder statesman for where? This na the same man wey once hold power with iron fist, now e dey receive birthday wishes like grandpa wey just blow candles on cake made from imported flour. E be touching, truly, but also funny how history dey recycle itself, one day you dey rule with decree, next you dey collect congratulatory notes. And if Babangida fit reach 84 still sharp, then maybe our own leaders go learn to age gracefully instead of aging disgracefully in office. You see, in Nigeria, retirement na word wey politicians hear but no understand, e be like say dem think power na vitamin that keep dem young forever. Me I pray say God give dem long life, but with sense to step aside when time reach, because even Bible talk about seasons, and season for ruling no be eternal like harmattan dust.

That bring me to another angle, this renewed appeal from Lagos state governor, Sanwo-Olu, wey him dey beg global investors to come pour money into climate change initiatives. Thursday e happen, him stand there talking about international climate summit or whatever, sounding like motivational speaker wey read too many TED talks. Him say Lagos ready for green energy, sustainable development, all those fancy words that make investor ears perk up. But hold on, my people, before we clap for this vision, remember say the same Lagos wey dey call itself Africa's biggest economy still dey battle with floods every rainy season, where danfo buses swim more than dem drive. E be like say we wan attract foreign money to fix what our own budget no fit handle, and I no blame am, because who no like free lunch? Yet, e funny how politicians abroad dey hear about our climate wahala and think say na opportunity, while we for inside dey fan ourselves with newspapers because AC don pack up. Sanwo-Olu, God bless your hustle, but make una first fix the potholes wey turn roads to swimming pools, then we go talk about saving the planet. After all, if earth dey warm up, at least let our streets no turn to sauna first.

Now, e get this undercurrent wey dey run through all these moves, like the way our government dey move to end the resident doctors' strike. Doctors wey dey fold arms, no dey attend to patients, and na so life dey hang for balance. Them summon everybody, negotiate, promise better pay, and suddenly e be like miracle don happen, strike suspend. Beautiful, abi? But I dey laugh inside because this na classic Nigerian dance, where workers strike, government drag foot, then everybody compromise and continue as if nothing happen. You know how e be, doctors need salary that match the stress of saving lives amid power cuts and medicine scarcity, while government dey count naira that dey flee faster than politician from accountability. E remind me of that biblical parable about laborers in vineyard, where some work from morning, others join late, yet all get same wage at end. But in our case, doctors work round the clock, and the wage na promise of tomorrow. Still, praise God say talks dey ongoing, because health na wealth, and without doctors, even politician fit catch panic when belle ache. Make una resolve am quick-quick, so that next time fever catch me, I no go dey pray for self-diagnosis.

Shifting gears here, because e connect to everything, this talk about lopsided projects, where people dey ask if Tinubu na president for whole Nigeria or just for his home base. You hear am? Projects popping up more in one area than others, like say federal allocation na family affair. E no surprise, oh, because politics na like jollof rice competition, everybody wan claim their version na the best. But seriously, when infrastructure dey favor certain zones, the rest of us dey feel like second-class citizens in our own country. Imagine traveling from east to west, and you see roads smooth in one place, while elsewhere e be like moon surface. God forbid bad thing, but e be time for balance, for equity that reflect one nation under His grace. No be by tribe or tongue, but by fairness, as scripture teach us to love neighbor as self. Politicians, if una fit share power like that, share progress too, so that every state feel the dividend, not just selected few.

And talking about sharing, e get this other news wey dey tickle me, about our government responding to that wild threat from Trump side, military action or whatever him mouth run. Them summon diplomats, assure say diplomacy dey work, and Tinubu himself talk say no fear, we dey handle am. E be like scene from action movie, where big man abroad bark, and our own stand firm, chest out. But truth be say, in 2026, with world dey hot like pot of egusi, na prayer we need more than saber-rattling. Because even if Trump dey joke or serious, Nigeria get enough internal battles without adding international drama. God dey our side, as Him always do, turning threats to testimonies, and making us stronger. Una see how faith fit anchor us amid storm? Politicians dey talk tough, but it's the Almighty wey provide real security.

One more thing before I wrap this yarn, e get this underlying Nigerian condition wey tie all together, where we dey coexist despite differences, as Sanwo-Olu himself mention in some speech. Challenged coexistence, him call am, and e true, because from market to mosque to church, we mix yet clash. But humor na our glue, abi? We laugh at the absurd, like governors switching parties or investors eyeing our chaos for profit. E be our way to survive, turning lemon to lemonade, or better, to palm wine that quench thirst. And in all, remember say grace abundant, even when plans falter. Politicians come and go, but our resilience, rooted in faith, stays.

So next time you hear about these twists, smile, because in Naija, comedy na therapy, and God na the ultimate director of this epic script. If life throw curveball, hit am back with laughter, and watch how it turns to home run. Peace out, my people.
