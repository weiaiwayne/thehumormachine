Eh, make I start by talking this matter wey dey hot now with our oga at the top jetting off to far places like Japan and Brazil, leaving us here to sweat under the sun. You see, while he's shaking hands with geishas and samba dancers, back home the youth are lining up for jobs that no dey show face. Imagine, you're applying for work, sending CV like confetti at a wedding, and the reply? Silence louder than thunderclap. And the big men from outside, like those IMF people, come tell us say fix everything in two years sharp sharp. Hah, two years? In this country, two years na just time to learn how to queue for rice that finish before you reach front. But wait, our oga fire back say e no realistic, and I dey nod head because e true die. Fixing wahala wey start from time of Noah? Abeg, that one go take eternity, or at least till Jesus come back with the blueprint.

Now, shifting gears to this strike wey doctors dey do, ending am at last, but the damage don already scatter everywhere. My sister wey dey teach for village, she born pikin last month, and the clinic? Empty like church on Monday. Doctor no dey, nurse dey fan herself with old newspaper, telling you say "go pray" as if paracetamol grow for heaven. And me sef, last time I fall sick, I self-medicate with agbo from mama market, mixing herbs like witch doctor on deadline. But seriously, when medics fold hand, na who go heal us? Politicians? Dem go prescribe "patience" and "prayer points" while dem fly first class to London for check-up. Shey you blame the doctors? No o, dem dey fight for salary wey fit buy garri for one week. And in the midst of this, I remember say even when body dey weak, the grace wey dey from above no dey strike. E dey there, steady like generator wey never conk out, reminding us say healing no just from syringe, but from upstairs too.

That brings me to another angle, this talk about projects wey some people dey call lopsided, like say the big man at the top dey build empire for only one corner of the map. Roads shining like mirror in some spots, bridges popping up faster than popcorn, but step to other side? Potholes deeper than well for village. Hah, I once travel by bus, and the driver shout "hold una belle" as we dive into crater wey fit swallow elephant. Passengers dey pray rosary mixed with juju incantation, begging saints and ancestors to save us from becoming roadkill. And the complaint? Say e look like favoritism, as if the whole nation na personal backyard. But e be like say when you plant seed for one place, the fruit no go spread equal. Me, I no fit complain too much, because if dem build road pass my house, I go be the first to cruise am with style. Yet, deep down, we all want that balance, that fairness wey Bible talk about, where the widow and the king both get share from the harvest. No be so? Politicians promise am every campaign, but deliver? More like 419 on national scale, collecting votes and vanishing with the loot.

Speaking on fairness, let's yarn about this voice from the governor for that bustling city, talking how e dey dangerous these days, and the challenge of living together as one. Coexistence? E sound like family meeting where uncle from east and cousin from north dey argue over who eat last meat. Beautiful on paper, but in practice? Clashes here, suspicion there, like oil and water wey refuse mix. And the danger? Pickpockets wey faster than Usain Bolt, traffic wey turn journey to marathon, and news wey full with stories wey make you lock door triple. But wait, e no surprise, because in a place where everybody hustle like life depend on am – which e does – tension go brew. I remember that time I board danfo, and the conductor collect money from everybody, but when change time reach, e vanish like ghost. "Oga, wetin be dis?" I ask, and him reply "na the Lagos tax, survive am!" Hah, but in all this chaos, there's that thread of hope, the one wey faith weave through, saying even in the storm, peace go come. Like how the good book talk about nations under one vine, no matter the thorns. We dey try, abi? Mixing our spices, our tongues, our dreams into one big pot of stew – sometimes e burn, but the taste? Unique, unbeatable.

Now, tie this to the big picture with that old general turning 84, getting shoutout from the top. Babangida, the man wey once hold the whip, now collecting cake and claps. E sweet, seeing elder statesman celebrated, but e make you think: after all the coups and changes, where we dey now? Still dancing same old jive, just with new DJ. And the foreign wahala? That voice from across the ocean threatening thunder, but our side dey talk diplomacy, summoning envoys like wedding guests. Me, I laugh because imagine if dem carry out that threat – soldiers marching in while we dey here debating whose turn e be to rule. But e go back to that core, the resilience wey God plant in us, turning threats to testimonies, fear to fire. Even when the world shake finger, we stand, pray, and push forward, because quitting no dey our dictionary.

One more twist: this appeal to global investors on climate change, sounding like plea for mercy from weather gods. Floods rising, heat baking us like akara in oil, and the governor begging for funds to cool things down. Fair point, because who wan live where rain turn road to river, and sun dey charge for sweating? But investors? Dem go come with conditions, strings attached like puppet show. "We go build solar, but una must dance our tune." And us? We go nod, because light no be luxury again, e be lifeline. Yet, in the heat, I find comfort in that eternal coolness promised from above, where no AC bill, just pure shade under the almighty wings. E no be escape, but e dey fuel the fight.

Wrapping this up, these twists and turns in our story, from strikes to strikes of lightning in politics, all point to one truth: we dey in the ring, but the referee upstairs no dey sleep. Politicians may fumble the ball, but grace catches it every time. So, keep laughing through the pain, praying through the plot twists, because in the end, the punchline na victory – not just for one side, but for all of us under this green-white-green sky. And if anybody ask why we no dey tire, tell dem: na the divine comedy we dey live, and e better than any script from Hollywood.
