Ah, my people! Chijioke Eze, live and direct! How una dey? Lagos traffic hold you? Or NEPA hold you hostage? Ehen, same difference!

So, I don dey browse Reddit and Nairaland this week, trying to understand una wahala. And let me tell you, the stress alone nearly aged me five years. Five years! I nearly started asking my babe for collagen supplements. But I digress.

First of all, Reddit dey vex me small. All this AI talk… AI writing articles, AI making art… Soon AI go dey run Nigeria better than our politicians! Imagine, an AI governor that actually finishes projects on time. Wait, what? Maybe that’s not so bad…

But seriously, wetin dey happen? I see one thread, person dey ask, "Naija is not a real place." Ah, bros, come on now. We know Naija is real. We dey suffer too much for it to be a dream! Masquerade dey ask babe for number? Maybe he just trying to diversify his hustle. Inflation reach masquerade hand too, you know.

Speaking of hustle, Tinubu, Baba himself, he dey work. Tax reforms here, policy changes there… E be like say Baba dey plan to tax the air we breathe. But I no blame am too much. He needs to fund all those "Renewed Hope" projects, abi? Which, by the way, I still dey wait for my own share of the renewed hope. I hope it comes with air conditioning and 24/7 power, because NEPA… ha! Don't even get me started.

Then Nairaland, the land of unfiltered opinions. Everybody is an economist, everybody is a political analyst, everybody is a prophet. I swear, if you listen to all the advice on Nairaland, you’ll end up owing CBN more money than Dangote has cement.

I saw one poster dey complain about men being rude. My sister, welcome to Nigeria! Honesty, sometimes na just coded insult. But ehn, the women too, they no dey carry last. Dem go give you back the rudeness with interest!

And then there’s the dating matter. One sister dey complain say her Naija man dey avoid her during her period. Ah, bros, wetin be dis nah? Fear? Superstition? Oga, you need to educate yourself o! Unless you believe say she go turn to mermaid for real, then maybe I understand your fear. But even then, mermaid fine nah!

See, the thing about Nigeria, ehn, is that we laugh to keep from crying. Remember Peter Rufai? Our legendary goalkeeper, may his soul rest in peace. He was the best. Now our goalkeepers be like, “Make I just collect the ball, or make I pose for Instagram?” But Rufai… he was a lion in the net. He gave us hope.

But now, sometimes, I feel like we’re all goalkeepers, desperately trying to keep out the problems that keep coming at us, wave after wave. Inflation, insecurity, NEPA... But we still dey laugh. We still dey make jokes. Because if we no laugh, we go cry. And crying no dey pay NEPA bill.

So, to all my people wey dey struggle, wey dey hustle, wey dey try make sense of this Naija wahala... I salute you! And remember, even when the light cut, the jokes must keep coming!
