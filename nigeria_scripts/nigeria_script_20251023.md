Ah, my brothers and sisters, make una hear this one wey dey make me shake head every time I check my phone for morning. See, e get this talk everywhere say our oga for up, that Tinubu man, na CIA spy wey dem plant come scatter our country. Chai, imagine o, person wey suppose dey run things here, e be say na Yankee people send am with secret mission. Wetin be this life? One minute you dey think say na local boy wey sabi hustle from Lagos streets, next minute, boom, e turn James Bond with Yoruba accent. Shey na so? Dem say e get hidden camera for him cap, recording every meeting, sending report back to Washington. And me, ordinary Chijioke, wey dey struggle to even spy on my neighbor's jollof wey dey smell too sweet, how I go believe say dis man na international agent? Abi, if na true, why e no use him superpowers fix our roads wey get more potholes than Swiss cheese? Or make dollar strong pass naira without sweat? E get as e be, but e sweet me die when I think say maybe e dey use him CIA money buy private jet, while we dey queue for danfo wey get no AC.

Now, speaking of hidden agendas, e get one open letter wey people dey circulate, addressed straight to the same oga, begging am to remember wey he come from. The writer dey pour out heart, talk say una suppose listen to the masses, no be only to your party boys. E be like say na love letter mixed with vex, full of "please sir, do something" and "wetin dey happen to our youth?" I read am three times, and e make me laugh because na so we dey do for Naija – write long epistle, post am online, then wait for miracle. But you know, e remind me of those biblical pleas to Pharaoh, where Moses dey yarn say let my people go, but here na let my people eat. And truly, if that letter reach heaven first before Aso Rock, maybe angels go drop some manna on us, because politicians here promise paradise but deliver pepper soup wey burn mouth. Shey you sabi wetin I mean? Even in church, when pastor dey preach on grace, e go say God's favor no dey selective, but for politics, e be say only few people dey chop the grace, while the rest of us dey manage crumbs. But e sweet, because hope still dey – one day, that grace go overflow like river Niger after rain.

That one don carry me go another matter, this by-election wey APC just win big time, and dem dey claim say na stamp of approval for their boss's style. Massive victory, dem call am, like say dem score hat-trick for World Cup. But wait first, who dey vote for by-election when everybody dey busy surviving? E be like say dem use magic or something, because last time I check, people dey grumble about empty pockets, yet dem go out en masse to thumb-print for the same old faces. Or maybe na the free rice and oil wey dem share before voting day – classic Naija move, bribe with stomach infrastructure. And me, if na me, I go take the rice, vote my conscience, then sell the oil for market to buy school fees for my pikin. But e get sense, because in this economy wey price dey climb faster than ladder for heaven, any win na win, even if na small corner. E just show say loyalty still dey strong, like faith in tough times. You see, even when things dey hard, we hold on, praying for that turnaround wey Bible talk about, where the last go be first. Maybe this victory na sign say better days dey come, or at least, na distraction from the wahala wey follow.

Ah, but let me yarn una about this comparison wey dey trend, USA government versus our own on tackling joblessness. Over there, dem get plans like tech hubs, training programs, even tax breaks for companies wey hire youth. Here? E be like say dem dey play 419 with curriculum vitae – you apply, wait six months, then hear say position don fill by nephew. Chai, wetin be this? Imagine if dem borrow idea from Yankee, make every graduate automatic entrepreneur with startup grant. But no, our side dey focus on speeches and promises wey sound sweet like chin-chin, but no filling. I remember one time, my cousin apply for federal job, e pass exam, interview, then vanish like ghost. Now e dey drive okada full time, hustling from dawn till dusk. And e no be him alone – millions dey same boat, paddling through flood of unemployment. But you know wetin keep us going? That inner strength, like what Paul talk about in scriptures, pressing toward the mark despite odds. Shey na why we no dey give up? Because even if government sleep on the job, God's plan no dey slumber. One day, those okada boys go turn CEOs, and we go laugh at how far we don come.

E sweet me to see Governor Soludo visit the top man, shaking hands like old pals planning owambe. Anambra boy meet national oga, and suddenly e be like family reunion. But wetin dem dey discuss for real? Road projects? Security? Or just comparing notes on how to dodge potholes in power? Soludo na sharp guy, e don achieve plenty as state helmsman – from cleaning up markets to pushing education – and now e dey there, maybe learning federal tricks or sharing state wisdom. E make me think say politics na like market bargaining, where you go with your ware, haggle, and hope to leave with better deal. But in Naija style, sometimes you end up with empty basket if you no sabi play the game. Yet, e get hope in such meetings, like when disciples gather to share testimonies, building each other up. Maybe from that visit, something good go flow down to us, like anointing oil from head to toe. Abi, who knows? Politicians fit surprise us with real change, turning water to wine for the masses.

Now, on why this Tinubu na special kind, people dey list him past feats as Lagos governor – infrastructure boom, revenue jump, even curbing street urchins. E be like say him get magic wand back then, waving am to make city shine. But now at national level, e be another kettle of fish, with 200 million mouths to feed, not just one megacity. Special how? Maybe in him resilience, like Job wey hold firm through trials. Or perhaps na him style, blending street savvy with big vision. I no fit lie, e inspire when you see person rise from grassroots to apex, proving say with grace, impossible na possible. But e funny too, because while we celebrate specials, ordinary folks like me still dey manage with one square meal, praying for our own breakthrough. Shey you feel me? Life na mixture of awe and struggle, but faith bridge the gap, reminding us say the best stories end with victory.

And talking achievements, if we count small-small, e go plenty – from stabilizing some sectors to pushing reforms wey long overdue. But e no dey easy, with global wahala like inflation biting hard. Yet, in the midst of it, we find joy in little wins, like when family gather for Sunday service, singing praises despite empty fridge. That na the real special – our ability to laugh through tears, trust in higher power wey no fail. So, next time you hear say na CIA plot or open letter drama, remember say behind the headlines, na people story, and hope dey alive. In fact, if politicians no deliver, at least heaven get reservation for all, no by-election required. Peace out, my people – keep shining!
