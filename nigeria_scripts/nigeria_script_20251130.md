Eh, make una hear this fresh gist wey dey hot pass pepper soup for rainy season. You sabi say our president don go wish happy birthday to that old general, Babangida, wey turn 84? I mean, IBB, the man wey used to rule back in the days with iron fist, now e dey collect congratulations like say na Grammy award. Imagine, 84 years, and e still dey sharp, probably plotting comeback like those Nollywood villains wey never die. Me, at 84, I go just dey sit for veranda, counting grandchildren and begging for garri. But no, IBB get style, e go reply with that military salute, "Thank you, sir!" even though na civilian president dey hail am. Shey you see the irony? One time military boss, now e dey collect cake from civilian oga. Life na turn by turn, abi? And the way Tinubu hail am, you go think say dem dey plan reunion tour for Aso Rock.

Now, shift gear small, let's yarn on this Bayelsa matter. The governor there, Douye Diri, just jump ship from PDP to APC like say na Black Friday sale for political parties. One day na opposition, next day na ruling party member, shaking hands with everybody. Me, I no blame am; politics na like our Nigerian queue for bank – you dey wait your turn, but if better offer come, you cut corner sharp sharp. Imagine if we apply this for everyday life: you dey line for danfo bus, driver shout "Oya, join APC side, free ride!" and half the queue don cross over. But seriously, this defection dey scatter PDP like confetti at wedding. Dem go wake up tomorrow, count heads, and see say half their people don port to where the rice and oil dey flow. E sweet pass jollof rice change, ehn? And the APC people dey celebrate like say dem win World Cup, hailing am as new brother. Brother for where? Na strategy, my people. In Naija politics, loyalty na like generator fuel – e finish quick, you find another source.

E get this other side wey dey make me laugh, this talk of transforming the oil industry. The minister just unveil plan, sounding like motivational speaker for church seminar. "We go revamp everything, make oil flow like River Niger!" But wait first, who believe this one? Last time dem promise transformation, we still dey import fuel while refinery dey idle like lazy apprentice. Now, dem wan extend deal between NNPC and Dangote, paying crude in naira instead of dollars. E sound good on paper, like say we go save foreign exchange and chop our own resources proper. But you know Naija, plans na like new year resolution – by February, e don fade. Imagine the meeting: big men for table, sipping malt, nodding heads, then outside, the same old wahala with queues at filling stations. Me, I dey pray say this one work, because if e no work, na back to black market we go, buying petrol for price of goat meat. And the government sef, dem do U-turn on that 15% fuel import tariff. One day na policy, next day na "Oya, cancel!" Like say dem dey testrun joke on us. Shey na trial and error, or na listening to street cry? Either way, e go better, but only if dem follow through. God's timing na perfect, e no dey do U-turn like our leaders.

Speaking on foreign wahala, this Trump matter still dey echo. The man, now back as US president, throw threat of military action our way, like say Naija na his backyard. And our government summon all diplomats for Abuja, responding with diplomacy talk. E be like Nollywood film: oyinbo giant dey shake fist, we dey smile and negotiate. President Tinubu assure everybody say e under control, engaging proper channels. But me, I dey wonder – wetin really dey behind this? Na oil, na trade, or just big man posturing? In Naija, we sabi handle such threats; remember Biafra days or even ASUU strikes? We endure, we talk, we survive. But this one dey involve Trump, the guy wey build walls and tweet fire. Imagine am land for Abuja with his red cap, shouting "You're fired!" to senators. No, we go handle am with our juju – prayer warriors go rise, bishops go fast, and politicians go wine and dine. At the end, peace go reign, because even when world dey shake, Nigerian spirit no dey bend. E like Bible say, in the midst of storm, anchor dey hold.

Now, let's touch this Anambra election neutrality from Tinubu. The APC for Lagos hail am for staying neutral, like say e be Olympic referee. No interference, just watching from sidelines. But you know how e be – neutrality in Naija politics na like virgin for Lagos club, e rare pass diamond. Dem praise am, say e promote peace, but deep down, everybody dey calculate votes. Anambra na Igbo heartland, and with all this one Nigeria talk turning mirage, neutrality sweet pass. I remember those days when ethnic fire dey burn, people shouting division. But Tinubu play cool, no pick side, and APC clap for am. Me, I clap too, because if e meddle, na another wahala we go yarn next week. E better make everybody play fair, like football match without referee bias. And for those wey dey complain say projects lopsided, favoring Lagos over others – shey na true? President for whole country, but some say na Lagos landlord. E no easy balancing 36 states, plus FCT. But with grace, e possible; like David face Goliath, small stone fit scatter giant plan.

E get this general vibe wey dey worry me, this challenged coexistence for Naija. Our Lagos governor, Sanwo-Olu, yarn say Nigeria dey face tough togetherness. True talk – from North to South, we dey mix like egusi soup, sometimes sweet, sometimes clump. Unemployment dey bite hard, youth dey hustle for street, government dey reply IMF say two years no enough to fix am. And World Bank chiefs dey visit, probably doling advice like pastor for altar. But we sabi the drill: plans plenty, execution scarce. Take that extraordinary Nigerian teen wey dey make waves – small boy, big brain, showing say hope dey even in chaos. Or that drummer confessing life struggles, banging beats while economy dey drum war. E inspire, ehn? Makes you think, if one person fit rise, why no all of us? But politicians promise heaven, only to deliver potholes. Thank God for real hope wey no disappoint, the one wey turn water to wine, not naira to scarcity.

And this fellow Nigerian brother gist wey dey trend, full of laugh emojis – na our way, turning pain to meme. Like when NEPA take light, we no cry, we gist am online. Or danfo driver wey dey curse traffic, we join chorus. Poverty dey, but humor no dey finish. Even family dynamics, mama dey pray for breakthrough while papa dey scheme 419 small small. No, no go there, but you get? Market life, bargaining till seller tire, that's our hustle. And cultural traditions, from owambe party to church vigil, e keep us going. Shey you feel me? In all this, faith na the glue – when leaders falter, higher power no dey sleep.

One more angle before I wrap this yarn: President Tinubu don depart for Japan and Brazil, probably sealing deals while we dey manage here. International trips sweet, but results? We wait. Like biblical prodigal son, e go return with fatted calf, hopefully. But if no change, we go still laugh, because Naija spirit na unbreakable. At the end, when all these political drama finish, na we, the people, go dance shakushaku to better days. And that, my friends, na the real transformation – not from ministers, but from above. Peace out, stay blessed.
