Eh, my people, e get this one thing wey dey happen for our side these days, make person just shake head ehn. You hear say the big oga for top don send invitation to all those embassy people from abroad, all gather for one place inside the capital. Why? Because another big man from across the ocean, that one wey dey wear red cap always, don open mouth talk say him fit send soldiers come here if things no correct themselves. Chai, imagine that scene, like say na movie script wey dem forget to edit. Him dey there, sitting pretty in him office, finger point at map, say "Nigeria, you better behave or else." And our side? Dem just call meeting, diplomatic talk-talk, assuring everybody say everything dey under control. But wetin I wan know be say, if na true, how dem go even land? Our roads no fit handle that kind traffic, e go be like rush hour for Third Mainland on steroids. And the soldiers? Dem go come, see our potholes, and turn back sharp-sharp, say "No ma, this no be war zone, na survival challenge."

Now, think am, this whole matter start from some noise wey dey fly around, something about security or whatever. But e reach point where person go ask, shey na joke or serious business? Because the response na to summon diplomats, like say na family meeting for village square. Everybody sit down, chop kola nut, discuss the issue. And the oga for top, him come out say him dey handle am diplomatically, no shaking. E sweet my ear, but e also make me remember how we dey do things here – talk plenty, action small-small. E be like when you go market, see fine cloth, haggle price, but at end, you buy wrapper wey no reach waist. Hope say this one go end well sha, because if not, na God go help us. You know, even in Bible, David face Goliath with stone, not with international call. But here, we dey use phone and meeting. Grace dey, though, e go cover the matter.

Shift gear small, you hear about that man from the creeks, the one wey dey lead that oil-rich place? One day him dey with the opposition crew, next morning, him don cross carpet go the ruling side. E happen just like that, no prior notice, no goodbye party. Now, the people wey dey hail am say na wise move, say him see the future clear-clear. But me, I dey wonder, wetin change overnight? Na dream or vision? Or na the kind calculation wey traders do for Balogun market, weigh options, pick the one wey go bring more profit. E no be first time, oh, politicians dey switch like channel on decoder, one minute PDP, next APC, tomorrow who knows. And the followers? Dem just follow, like sheep wey see better grass. But e funny pass, because if na you or me, switch job like that, boss go sack us sharp. Here, dem promote am. Abi, na the beauty of the game? Or na the wah – sorry, the twist wey make everything exciting. Thank God say Him no dey change sides; loyalty from beginning to end, redemption for all who call on Him.

E remind me of another gist, this one about celebrating age. The oga for top send greetings to that old general, the one wey rule before with iron fist, now him clock 84. Congrats everywhere, messages of long life, health, all that. E sweet, ehn, see how dem remember yesterday's heroes. But e also make person think, 84 years, wetin him see? From military days to now, the country don turn how many times? Him probably dey laugh inside, say "I told you so" on some matters. And the greetings? Na like birthday card from state house, fancy paper, big words. But for real life, when person reach that age, na prayer we need most – strength for the journey, grace to finish strong. Not just cake and candles, but the kind blessing wey come from above, like manna in desert. Politicians fit congratulate, but only the Almighty dey give extra years.

Now, let's talk this other angle, the one wey dey touch health workers. Those doctors wey dey strike, tired of the plenty wahala – low pay, bad conditions, all join. The top side dey move to end am, negotiations here and there, promises of better days. E good, because without dem, who go treat us when belle ache from bad food? But e take time, ehn, like when you go hospital, wait for hours, doctor come say "Rest small." Rest how, when economy dey bite? And the strike? E affect everybody, patient dey suffer, but doctors too dey hungry. Na vicious circle, one hand wash the other, but both dey dirty. Hope say dem reach agreement soon, because health no dey wait for politics. And in the mix, e be like reminder from scripture – body na temple, care for am, but also, pray for wisdom in leadership, so that healing no only come from medicine, but from just systems too.

E get this climate matter too, the man wey dey run the commercial city dey appeal to investors from far and wide, say come put money for green projects, fight change together. International climate summit or whatever, him dey there, pitching ideas, showing data. E sound high-level, ehn, suits and ties, handshakes. But on ground, we still dey battle flood every rainy season, drainages blocked with pure water sachets. Investors go come, build solar or whatever, but who go maintain am when NEP – sorry, when power people strike again? E funny, because while dem dey talk global warming, our own heat dey from sun and frustration. Shey dem go invest in fans or real change? Time go tell. But e make sense to pray for visionaries, those who see beyond today, like prophets of old, calling for stewardship of the land God give us.

And oh, that refinery deal, the national oil company and the private giant dey talk to extend supply with local currency, no more dollars chase. E supposed ease the pressure on exchange, make things flow better. But me, I dey watch, because deals like this, dem start sweet, end with questions. Who benefit pass? The big boys or the common man wey dey queue for product? E be like marriage arrangement – vows today, drama tomorrow. Yet, e point to hope, that with smart moves, economy fit turn corner. And faith? E dey there, believing that provision come from unexpected places, like ravens feeding Elijah.

You see, all these pieces – threats from abroad, switches inside, celebrations, strikes, appeals, deals – dem weave one big tapestry of our story. Sometimes e tear, sometimes e shine. But through am all, one thing steady: the grace wey hold us, the hope wey no disappoint. Politicians fit shift, threats fit come, but the Higher Power no. So, as we laugh at the madness, make we hold that truth tight. Because in the end, na Him wey dey laugh last, and best. And if Trump send soldiers, make dem bring AC first – our heat no dey play.
