E get one thing wey dey baffle me these days, like say international politics don turn to one kind Nollywood script wey nobody fit predict. You hear about this American president, Trump, wey dey throw threat like say na confetti for wedding? Him talk say make dem take military action against Naija, ehn? Wetin? For wetin na? We no dey owe dem money pass the ones wey dem dey owe us for all those old slave trade reparations wey dem forget. But our oga, Tinubu, no send. Him summon all those foreign diplomats for Abuja, like say e dey call family meeting to settle wahala. Imagine, all those oyinbo ambassadors sitting down for one room, sweating under Naija sun, while Tinubu dey yarn say, no wahala, we go handle am diplomatically. Diplomatic how? With jollof rice and pounded yam? Or maybe him go send dem go back with some garri to remember say life fit be tough.

But seriously, my brothers and sisters, this kind threat e dey show say even for outside, dem see our matter as one big comedy show. Shey you sabi? Like, Trump dey there for him White House, probably eating burger, and him decide say Naija need military lesson. For climate change? For election? Or just because him hear say our naira dey dance better than him dollar these days? No be small thing o. And Tinubu response? Him say him government dey engage diplomatically. Engage how? By calling pastor to pray? Because e be like say only divine intervention fit calm this one. You know, in the Bible, David no use sword face Goliath at first; him use faith. Maybe that's the play here – pray make Trump remember say Naija na land of grace, where even when economy dey shake, God's promise no dey waver.

Now, speaking of party switching wey dey make headlines, you see this Bayelsa governor wey dump PDP join APC? E be like say politics na one big market where everybody dey haggle for better position. One day you dey red, next day you wear yellow, like say na fashion show. Him reason say APC get more juice, more power, more everything. But e get question: wetin happen to all those promises wey him make when e dey PDP? Dem don expire like old fufu? Or him just dey follow the wind, like leaf for harmattan? Na so life be for Naija politics – today you dey opposition, tomorrow you dey ruling party, and the people? We just dey watch, hoping say at least e go bring better road or light. But e no dey happen. Instead, we get more defection than stable electricity. And when NEPA take light again, you go remember say even politicians fit switch, but generator fuel price no dey switch down.

Ah, that one pain me pass. These doctors strike wey government dey try end, ehn? Resident doctors dey fold arm, say dem no go work until salary improve. And who suffer? Us, the common people wey go hospital with malaria, only to find say nobody dey attend. You go there, queue from morning, only for dem to say strike dey on. So you go back house, pray say fever no turn to something worse. Government say dem go negotiate, but negotiation for Naija na like bargaining for Oshodi market – plenty talk, small change. Meanwhile, Sanwo-Olu for Lagos dey appeal to global investors about climate change. Him yarn say make dem come invest for green energy, for sustainable future. E sound good, abi? But when last time rain fall for Lagos and flood take over street, where those investors? Dem dey London, sipping tea, while we dey paddle canoe go work. Shey na climate change or just poor drainage? Because if e be climate, why e no flood Maitama for Abuja? Na selective wahala.

You know how e be, this our daily grind. Wake up morning, face traffic wey longer than Bible verse. Danfo driver dey shout, "O wa pa!" but e no reach office on time. Then you get to work, only to hear say salary no fit buy even one bag of rice. Unemployment dey everywhere, like bad odor for public toilet. Government dey talk about tackling am, but tackling how? With more seminars? Or by importing ideas from USA wey no fit our reality? Even when dem reply IMF say fixing problem no be two years work, e sweet my ear. Because truth be say, our wahala deep pass that. But e get hope, you know. Like that story for scripture where prodigal son return home, and father welcome am with open arms. Maybe one day, our leaders go return to sense, and we go get redemption from all this economic prodigal living.

And talking about birthdays wey dey make news, Tinubu congratulate Babangida on him 84th. IBB, the former military president, still dey sharp like cutlass. Him yarn say happy birthday, and IBB probably smile, remember days when him dey rule with iron fist. But now, e be like say history dey repeat, only softer version. Tinubu dey try play neutral for Anambra election, and APC hail am for that. Neutral how? Like Switzerland, or like referee wey dey collect brown envelope from both sides? Lagos APC say e good, but e get people wey dey ask: president of Naija or just Lagos landlord? Because all these projects, dem dey favor one side pass. E be like say one Nigeria na dream, mirage like say you dey see water for desert. But we no fit give up. Faith dey tell us say, even in division, unity fit come through grace. Like how family wahala resolve after church service – everybody go chop and forget.

Now, imagine this: NNPC and that big refinery dey talk about extending deal for crude supply with naira. Sound like progress, abi? No more dollar wahala for oil. But wait, when last time such deal no turn to another 419 scheme? Dem promise heaven, but deliver pepper. You go hear say e go crash fuel price, but next week, queue go long pass church for crusade. And we, the people, go still dey push okada for bad road, praying say tank no empty before we reach house. E be the Nigerian condition – full of promise, short on delivery. But e get one thing wey no dey change: our resilience. We dey survive, laugh through pain, because as e dey Bible, joy come in morning after night of crying. So even when Trump threaten or governor defect, we go still dey here, cracking jokes, holding on to that hope wey no dey disappoint.

One more thing before I wrap this yarn. Sanwo-Olu dey go international climate summit, talking big about investment. Him say Lagos ready for green revolution. Green how? With solar panel wey NEPA go still cut off? Or electric bus wey go jam for Third Mainland Bridge? E sweet, but reality na say, when power go out, we go back to generator, and that one dey drink fuel like politician dey chop budget. But maybe, just maybe, this time e go work. Because if faith can move mountain, e fit power our grid too. Shey you believe? No worry, even if no, we go manage with candle and prayer. That's Naija spirit – turn lemon to lemonade, or better, to zobo drink.

And finally, this whole Trump matter dey remind me of one old Naija proverb: when elephant fight, grass suffer. But in our case, when big men abroad dey quarrel with our own, we go just dey pray make peace reign. Because war no be option; peace na the way, as Jesus teach. So, to all those leaders, cool down. Naija go survive, with or without threat. We don pass worse. And that's the truth, straight from Lagos heart.
