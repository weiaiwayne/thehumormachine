Wetin dey happen for this country sef, e be like say our leaders don turn international drama series, complete with Yankee twists and diplomatic wahala. Imagine, one big oga from across the ocean, the man wey dey wear red cap and talk tough, drop threat say him go send soldiers come scatter our peace here. Military action? For wetin? Na so dem summon every foreign big man to one room for capital, like say na emergency village meeting wey chief priest call to chase evil spirit. And our head man, him respond say e dey handle am with sweet talk and handshakes. Me I dey wonder, if Yankee boy come with guns, wetin be the plan? Use juju or pepper soup to calm dem down? Because last time I check, bullet no dey respect diplomacy pass how mosquito respect net.

That one no even finish, see another matter wey dey sweet pass. This governor from that oil-rich place, the one wey dey Bayelsa, wake up one morning and decide say e no wan stay with old party again. Him dump am like bad boyfriend, jump go the other side wey dey promise better jollof. APC, welcome! Now him go meet the top dog, shake hands, smile for camera, as if yesterday no get grudge. Na so politics dey work? Today you dey curse opponent like say na witch, tomorrow you dey hail am like long-lost brother. Me sef, if na me, I go defect from my wife kitchen to neighbor own if dem promise free rice. But seriously, how dem no dey tire? One day PDP na devil, next day APC na angel with halo. And the people wey vote, wetin be our own? We just dey watch this musical chairs, hoping say the music no stop on empty seat.

Speaking of musical chairs, e get this other twist wey dey make me laugh till my belle pain. The man from Enugu, another big shot, do the same juju – defect go APC, then straight to see the boss for photo op. Like say na reward for switching teams mid-game. Now, I hear say dem dey hail neutrality for some election for Anambra, say the top man no take side. Neutrality? In Naija politics? That one na miracle wey even Moses no see for Red Sea. Because normally, neutrality be like saying NEPA go give light 24/7 without generator backup. Impossible! But e sweet to see, abi? At least for once, no be say one side dey chop everything. Though, truth be say, whether neutral or not, the road wey dem build still dey pothole everywhere, and the clinic wey dem open still dey wait for drug.

Now, let me yarn you something wey dey touch ground level, away from all this big man wahala. Our Lagos oga, the one wey dey run this concrete jungle, wake up and decide to beg investors come put money for climate something. International climate change? Him dey appeal say make dem come build green things, fight global warming. Brother, before you talk climate, wetin you do with the flood wey dey chase people from market every rainy season? Or the traffic wey turn Third Mainland to parking lot, where danfo driver dey curse pass pastor on Sunday. Investors go come, see our sun wey dey roast like grill meat, and run back say na oven, not opportunity. And climate change for Naija? E be like say global warming dey target us specially – heat increase, but AC no dey work because fuel scarce. Me I dey pray, say make God send cool breeze, because even heaven know say hell no fit compete with Lagos afternoon.

E get one thing wey dey puzzle me sha, this talk of one Nigeria wey some people dey question. Like say for Lagos, some group dey feel say e no real, mirage like water wey you see for hot road. Igbos wey dey hustle for market, Yorubas wey dey control bus stop, Hausas wey dey sell suya – all mix up, but tension dey bubble underneath. And now with all this defection and threat from outside, e be like say the pot wey dey boil don add more pepper. But wetin I know? Naija na family, dysfunctional one, where uncle dey fight nephew over inheritance, but when outsider come, dem unite to chase am. Even Bible talk say house wey divide against itself no stand, so make we no let small quarrel turn to earthquake. Grace dey hold us, e no go let go.

That remind me of another angle, this old military head, the one dem call Babangida, clock 84, and our current boss send congratulation. 84? That man see plenty – coup, oil boom, everything. Him dey smile now, but back then, him action make some people head spin like Okada for bad road. Congratulation sweet, but I dey hope say e come with wisdom too, because at that age, story wey you carry plenty pass Nollywood script. Maybe him fit whisper to the young ones say politics no be war, na service. Though, from wetin I see, service mean chop first, serve later. And Yankee threat? Him go laugh say na small fry compared to wetin him face.

Now, shift gear small, talk of economy wey dey tie with all this. Dem say government dey tackle unemployment, but how? With what? Dem reply IMF say fixing problem in two years na joke, unrealistic. True talk! Because unemployment for Naija be like queue for bank – long, frustrating, and sometimes you reach front, dem say system down. Young boys wey graduate dey hawk pure water instead of CV. And now with climate appeal, maybe dem go create job for tree planting, but who wan plant when rain no fall proper? Me sef, I dey think say if Yankee come with military, at least dem go bring job – as cook or laundry man for barracks. But no, better make peace reign, because war no solve hunger, e multiply am.

E be like say everywhere, project dey favor one place pass other. People dey murmur say na Lagos president wey we get, not Nigeria. Roads, bridges, everything shine for island, but go inside, na dust and dream. Lopsided? Na so e be, like mama wey favor first born with better cloth, leave last born with hand-me-down. But hope dey, redemption come in seasons. Even when project no reach your corner, faith say better day dey come, like prodigal son wey return with full pocket. Politicians promise heaven, but only the real Father deliver without condition.

One more thing wey dey crack me up – this protest for Lagos, mix with emir tussle for Kano. People dey march, shout for change, while up north, traditional title dey fight like wrestlers. Emir who? Which one? E be like family reunion wey turn brawl over who sit head table. And protest? Dem gather, wave sign, but police dey watch like hawk. Wetin dem want? Better life, fair share. But after shout, dem go back to hustle, because Naija no dey sleep on problem, e face am with grit. Though, if Trump hear of our internal drama, him go think say na movie, not reality.

In all this, I dey see pattern – leaders dey dance, we dey watch, but sometimes we join the rhythm. Defection today, threat tomorrow, climate tomorrow-next. But deep down, Naija spirit strong, like palm wine wey no sour easy. And with a touch of grace, we go turn wahala to testimony. Imagine, if all these big men sit down, yarn true true, maybe peace go flow like Niger River. But for now, we laugh, because laughter na medicine wey no need prescription. So next time Yankee threaten, make dem know say Naija no fear – we get jollof, we get vibe, and above all, we get God wey no dey slumber. Peace!
