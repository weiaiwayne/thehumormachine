Eh, my brothers and sisters, imagine this scene wey dey play out for our country like bad Nollywood film. You see this Bayelsa governor, one minute him dey PDP, next thing, him don jump ship go APC like say na hot akara wey dey burn hand. Wetin be this na? Politicians dey treat parties like change-over for danfo bus, hop on, hop off, no loyalty, just survival. Me, I dey wonder, if dem fit switch like that, why we no fit switch our own wahala so easy? One day poverty, next day riches, abi? But no, dem go stay for dem corner, chop money, leave us to hustle.

That one alone no finish. Now, add this twist with our big oga, President Tinubu, sending birthday wishes to former military head, Babangida, as him clock 84. Ah, congratulations o, but shey you no see the irony? One time, military boys dey rule with iron fist, now dem dey get cake and candles from civilian boss. It's like reuniting old classmates at school reunion, except dem classmates used to flog you for late coming. Babangida, that man wey open gates for economy, but now gates dey locked against small man like me. At 84, him still sharp, maybe him go teach Tinubu how to juggle states like before. But me, I just hope say the cake no get poison, because politics sweet pass but e fit bitter quick.

Speaking of bitterness, let's talk this matter with America and their big mouth president-elect, Trump, threatening military action here. Chai, wetin be this? Him say make una fear, but our government quick quick summon all diplomats for Abuja, like say na emergency family meeting. Tinubu respond say dem dey handle am diplomatically, no wahala. Diplomatically? As in, sweet talk and handshakes? My people, if na true war dem want, why no send soldiers wey go face Boko or bandits first? No, dem prefer threaten from afar, while we here dey dodge potholes like landmines. Imagine Trump calling, "Nigeria, pay up or boom!" And we answer, "Oga, abeg, come see our roads first, that na war zone already." But seriously, in this our condition, even when threats fly, I remember say the Bible talk about peace that pass understanding. So, while dem dey plot, make we hold that peace, because no bomb fit touch God's plan.

But wait, shift gear small, you know how Sanwo-Olu, that Lagos state head, dey appeal to global investors about climate change? Him stand there Thursday, talking international climate something, make foreign money flow in. Eh, good idea, but shey dem investors go come build factories or just chop jollof and go? Lagos, with all its heat and flood, now dey beg for green money. Imagine, one side rain dey pour like tears from heaven, other side traffic jam dey cook people alive. Sanwo-Olu say make dem invest, but me I say, start with fixing bridges wey collapse every rainy season. Climate change? Yes o, but our own version na when generator smoke mix with exhaust from okada, turning air to pepper soup. And for we Christians, e remind me of stewardship, like Adam for garden, but here na concrete jungle wey need God's rain to cool down, not destroy.

Now, tie this to bigger picture, this talk of tackling unemployment between USA and our side. Dem dey compare notes, like say America get formula wey fit cure our jobless wahala. But wetin dem no know na, here job hunting na own marathon. You graduate, send CV like love letters, but reply na "position filled" or silence. Government promise programs, but e end up like promise and fail. I hear dem say Tinubu reply IMF, say fixing problems no be two years matter, e go take time. Time? As in, wait till Jesus come back? My brother, unemployment dey push youth to yahoo or street, but faith say wait on the Lord, him go renew strength. So, while we wait, make we no fold hands; hustle small, pray more.

Ah, and don't let me forget this NNPC and refinery deal, extending supply with naira, no more dollar wahala. Sounds smart, keep money inside, but shey e go reduce price at pump? No be my business to predict, but Nigerians don learn to doubt. One time announcement sweet, next queue long pass church on Easter. It's like marriage vow, everybody clap, but later na argument. In our daily grind, market woman dey haggle for tomato wey cost like gold, because supply chain dey play 419. Shey you understand? That woman, rising 5am, praying for sales, that's the real economy. And for her, grace dey sufficient, even when profit small.

Let me yarn una one small story to drive point home. Last week, I dey market, trying buy fish, but seller say price up because of this diplomatic noise and investor talk. Him say, "Bros, Trump threaten, so fish dey fear, price climb." I laugh, but e true. Everything connect, from high table to low stall. Politicians switch parties like Bayelsa man, congratulate old generals, beg investors, reply threats with talk, but ground no move. We still dey manage with one bulb from solar, because power na luxury. But here's the beauty, in all this mess, Nigerians resilient like ant for sugar. We laugh, we pray, we push. Remember Proverbs, wise man build house, but foolish one scatter. So, make our leaders build, not scatter, and if dem no hear, God's wisdom go guide us through.

Now, think about this Igbos in Lagos matter, where some say one Nigeria na illusion. Ah, painful talk, but e come from heart. People dey feel sidelined, like guest for own house. Projects lopsided, say Tinubu favor one side. Is e true? Me no be judge, but unity na work, not juju. Like church family, sometimes quarrel, but Sunday we gather. If politicians no bridge gap, we go do am with jollof and highlife music. No let division win; e no pay.

And this Nigerian condition, e dey challenged, as Sanwo-Olu himself talk about coexistence. Lagos most dangerous? With crime and rush, yes, but also most vibrant. Teen wey dey do extraordinary things, brothers connecting online with memes, that's hope. Even drummer confessing life struggles, e show say behind beat, na story of perseverance. For 2025 end, as year close, make we reflect. Politicians did their dance, we did ours. But come 2026, if wahala persist, remember, only one redeemer no dey switch sides – that's Jesus. Him promise rest, not threats or empty appeals.

One more angle before I round. This matter of Tinubu meeting World Bank chiefs, shaking hands for loans or advice. Dem come with big books, say cut here, tax there. But our oga say, unrealistic to fix quick. True talk, because Rome no build in day, and Nigeria no be small Rome. It's empire with potholes. Imagine World Bank man saying, "Invest in education," and we reply, "We dey try, but teachers dey strike like doctors." Strikes everywhere, from health to lecture halls. Government move to end doctors' one, good, but shey e go stick? Like prodigal son, come back, but no waste again. Faith teach forgiveness, but also wisdom to avoid repeat.

In all, my people, as we face these twists – party jumps, birthday claps, threat dodges, investor begs – make humor be our shield. Because if we no laugh, cry go take over. And God's got the last laugh, turning mourning to joy. So, here's to Nigeria, may she rise, not just survive. And if Trump call again, tell am, "Oga, military no need; send jobs instead." Peace out.
