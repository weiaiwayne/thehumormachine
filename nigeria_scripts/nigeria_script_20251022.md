Ah, see this life wey dey sweet pass honey but sharp like razor blade sometimes. Imagine o, one day you dey wake up, stretch your body, and next thing, you hear say our big man for the top don get visitors from far state, dem dey greet like old friends wey no see each other since secondary school. Soludo roll in, smile everywhere, shake hand with Tinubu like say dem dey share secret recipe for better tomorrow. But wait, shey na real talk or just camera angle? Because one minute dem dey pose for picture, next minute we still dey wait for that magic wand to touch our pockets.

You see am? Dem talk say this visit na bridge building, like say Anambra and the center dey plan joint venture. But me I think say na like when your neighbor borrow your gen for one night, promise to return am next day, but e turn to permanent loan. Soludo come, talk development, Tinubu nod head, but where the action? We dey here, hustling under hot sun, waiting for that endorsement to turn to real cash. Abi, is it not the same story every time? Politicians gather, chop small jollof – wait no, I mean discuss vision – but vision without action na just daydream.

Now, let me yarn you about this open letter wey one person drop like bomb. E dey go straight to Tinubu, like say na personal advice from uncle to nephew. The writer talk say, oga, see how things dey hard, people dey suffer, do something quick. But e be like say the letter land for spam folder. Because after that, nothing change. We still dey queue for rice, beg for small mercy. And the funny part? Dem claim say Tinubu special, like say e get super power from somewhere. Some even whisper say e be agent from that Yankee side, CIA or wetin. Ha! If na true, then why our roads still dey like village path? Why unemployment dey chase graduate like dog after bone? Dem say e special because e build when e dey Lagos – wait, no mind that one, e be old gist – but special how? Special to promise heaven but deliver pothole?

Shey you understand? This by-election wey APC win big, dem shout say na stamp of approval for the whole setup. Massive victory, dem call am, like say na World Cup final. But victory for who? For the party wey dey chop the national cake, or for the youth wey no see job since NYSC? Dem win seats, but we lose sleep over bills. E be like saying you win lottery but the prize na another form to fill. And now, compare our hustle with Yankee way. Over there, dem dey throw money at job creation, train people, give grant like sweet. Here? We dey pray for small internship wey no pay. Wahala everywhere, but dem say we go survive. Survive ke? With what? Grace from above, that's the only thing wey no dey fluctuate like dollar.

Speaking of grace, e remind me of how we dey hold on to faith even when everything scatter. Like that time when economy dey bite hard, but church dey full every Sunday, people dey dance like say tomorrow no dey. Because truly, politicians fit promise light but forget to pay the bill, but the one upstairs never fail. E dey there, steady like rock, whispering say hold on, redemption dey come. No be by power or might, but by that quiet strength wey no politician fit touch. So even when dem talk achievement like building bridges or fixing water, we know say the real bridge na the one to better life, and water na living water wey no dey dry.

But wait, let me shift gear small. Imagine this wahala with unemployment, USA versus us. Dem over there dey do program, skill up youth, make dem own business. Here, we dey do what? Wait for handout or dash? One side, Silicon Valley dey birth billionaire from garage, other side, we dey turn okada to office on wheels. No be joke o, some graduate now dey drive bike full time, call am entrepreneurship. And Tinubu, dem say e special for that – turning challenge to opportunity. But opportunity for who? For the one wey get connection, or for the boy from village wey no know anybody? E be like saying you open shop but lock the door for customer.

Ah, and this heaven of – wait, no mind that, e be too heavy. But seriously, why we no fit tackle job like dem do abroad? Dem have policy, we have prayer warrior. Both work, but one faster. Or maybe na our style, mix both: pray in the morning, hustle in the afternoon. That's Naija spirit, unkillable. Even when letter dey fly, visit dey happen, win dey come, we still dey stand. Because deep down, we know say true change no come from hand shake alone, but from heart wey dey seek justice. And justice? That one na from the king of kings, no be from any agent or special man.

Now, picture this absurdity: Soludo visit, talk partnership, but back home, people dey ask, wetin e bring? Rice? Money? Or just photo for album? And APC dey celebrate by-election like say e solve everything. But solve wetin? The queue for passport? The hike in school fee? No, e just mean more people to chop from the same pot. And that pot, e dey leak everywhere. So we, the masses, dey use spoon to fetch ocean. Funny abi? But e pain small.

Let me tell you story wey happen last week – not real name o. My cousin, fresh from uni, send CV everywhere. Company one call am for interview, but e be like audition for Nollywood. Dem ask question wey no relate to job, then say sorry, position full. Full with who? Nepotism graduate? So e turn to freelance, sell phone credit from corner. That's our reality, turning no to yes with pepper and smile. And Tinubu special because e know that grind? Maybe, but special no mean e fit fix for everybody. Only one fit do that, the one wey turn water to wine, no be promise to wine but no water.

Shey you see the pattern? Visit come, letter go, win happen, but the struggle dey dance k-leg. Unemployment dey mock us, like say e get PhD in frustration. USA dey laugh, say una still dey use stone age method? We no mind, we go innovate. Like how we use torchlight when light go – wait, no, fresh angle: we use phone torch for everything, from reading Bible to cooking night. That's grace in action, light in darkness. No matter how CIA agent or special oga try, darkness fit come, but our inner light no dim.

And this open letter, e be like cry from wilderness. Writer pour heart, say oga, hear us, do the needful. But needful na what? Cut the wahala, share the wealth. Instead, we get more talk. Talk na cheap, like okada fare before hike. So we dey wait, hope say one day, the special one remember say special include all of us. Not just the inner circle, but the boy wey dey hawk, the mama wey dey market. Because in the end, true achievement no be by-election win, but soul wey find peace. And peace? That one no dey campaign, e just come when you open heart.

But here's the twist: maybe all this na setup for bigger comedy. Politicians dey act like Nollywood star, we dey watch, clap small, then go back to real life. Soludo visit na episode one, letter na plot twist, by-election na climax. But the real star? The one wey write the script from beginning. E no need agent, no need win, just grace wey cover everything. So even when job no dey, we dey work with faith, turn unemployment to testimony. That's how we roll, laughing through the storm.

Ah, my people, if life na stage, we all director. Tinubu special? Yes, but we special too, children of the most high. So next time dem visit or win, we go smile, say okay, but we no go sleep. We go push, pray, and one day, the heaven dem promise go land – not the corrupt one, but the real paradise. And till then, we go jest, because laughter na medicine wey no dey expire. Peace out, or better, grace abound.
