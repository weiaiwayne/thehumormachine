Eh, my people, make una picture this one: some big man from across the ocean, Donald Trump, dey wake up one morning and decide say Nigeria too sweet, so him go send soldiers come chop jollof here. Wetin be this? Like say we get oil wey dey call name, or maybe him hear say our pepper soup too hot, so him wan cool am down with military boot. And our president, Tinubu, no waste time, summon all the diplomats for Abuja like say na emergency family meeting. "Oya, come siddon, make we talk this matter before e turn to Nollywood film." Him talk say government dey engage diplomatically, assuring everybody say no shaking. But me, I dey wonder, wetin una dey engage? Na prayer point or chess game? Because if Trump dey serious, e go be like biblical Goliath coming for David, but this time, our stone na naira wey no fit reach far.

You see, this diplomatic wahala remind me of how we dey handle things back home. Politicians promise heaven and earth, but when thunder strike, na only God grace wey dey cover us. Like say, even in the face of foreign threats, we go still find way to dance shakushaku and say "it is well." Shey you sabi that feeling? When life wan press you, you just lift eye up and remember say higher power dey watch. No be so? But seriously, Tinubu government talking tough, but deep down, we all know say na God wey dey fight our battles, not just embassy calls.

Now, shift gear small to this Bayelsa matter. The governor there, one day him wake up, look PDP flag wey him dey wave since, and say "abeg, this one no dey work again." Next thing, him jump fence go APC side like say na Black Friday sale. Wetin happen? Na the grass greener or him see better keke to ride? In Naija politics, party switching na like changing underwear – you do am quick, nobody ask question. But imagine the wahala for him house: wife dey cook PDP stew one side, children dey play APC game other side. E go be confusion everywhere. And the people of Bayelsa, dem just dey watch like say na WWE match, cheering whoever fit deliver fish and clean water. But truth be say, whether PDP or APC, the real champion na the one wey go fix that river wey dey carry current like serpent.

This switching business no new sha, but e dey make me think of redemption, you know? Like prodigal son wey come back home, but instead of fatted calf, na party logo dem kill. Politicians dey run from one camp to another, but if dem fit run go Jesus feet, maybe e go be permanent change. Abi, shey una think say if dem hear sermon on faithfulness, dem go stop this musical chairs? No be joke o, because in this country, loyalty na like scarce mineral – everybody dey mine am for personal gain.

Oya, let me yarn una about this Babangida birthday matter. Tinubu send congratulations to the former military president as him clock 84. Eh, 84 years? That man don see coups, see transitions, see everything wey fit happen in one lifetime. Him dey there like ancient baobab tree, watching generations come and go. Tinubu talk say him dey hail the general for wisdom and service. Service? Make una no mind that one – na the same service wey bring June 12 wahala, or e be the one wey open bank accounts for everybody? But at 84, Babangida still sharp, probably dey laugh inside say "these young ones never reach my level of oga at the top."

Imagine birthday party for such legend: cake shape like coup tank, candles wey no fit blow out because wind of change too strong. And Tinubu, as current oga, dey send message like say "uncle, happy birthday, make I inherit your playbook." But me, I dey hope say this congratulations na sign of peace, not plot. Because in Naija, even birthday wishes fit carry hidden agenda. Yet, turning 84 na milestone wey shout grace – God's own promotion wey no need election. Shey una see? While politicians dey celebrate with pomp, the real longevity na from above, not from ballot box.

Speaking of celebrations, this Christmas season dey add pepper to everything. December 25, and here we dey, still dodging one drama or the other. But wait, let me connect this to Sanwo-Olu matter. The Lagos governor, on Thursday, make appeal to global investors about climate change. Him talk say Lagos State International Climate something, calling for money to fix environment. But Lagos, the same place wey dem call most dangerous state? Wetin be this? Una wan invite investors come where traffic dey swallow people alive, where flood dey turn street to river Nile every rainy season. Sanwo-Olu dey paint picture of green future, but reality na that one pothole fit sink Tesla.

Imagine investor from abroad, hear appeal, pack bag come Lagos. Him land, enter danfo, jam hold-up wey last three hours, then rain fall, him shoe spoil. By time him reach meeting, him go say "abeg, I go send money from afar, no need come." And climate change? In Lagos, na we own version: heat wey make person sweat like sinner in hell, or flood wey carry away market goods. Sanwo-Olu wan fix am, but how? With more billboards or prayer points? Because if na government alone, e go be like using spoon to bail ocean.

This appeal remind me of our daily hustle with nature's wahala. One time, rain fall for my area, water enter room like uninvited guest, spoil electronics. Me, I just kneel down, thank God say at least roof no fly away. That's the faith wey carry us – even when world dey hot up, His coolness dey calm storm. Shey una feel me? Investors fit come with dollars, but real change na from heart, and maybe small fasting to cool the temperature.

Now, to cap this, let's touch the doctors' strike wey government wan end. Resident doctors dey fold arm, say salary and conditions no reach. Government move to talk, promise this and that. But in Naija hospitals, strike na like NEPA – come and go, leave patient in dark. Imagine person sick, go clinic, see "closed for strike," next thing him go pharmacy buy paracetamol for malaria. Wetin be life? Doctors wan better pay, but patients wan life. E be like David and Goliath again, but this time sling na stethoscope.

Government say dem dey negotiate, but negotiation in Naija na like bargaining for market: start high, end low, everybody grumble. And the people? We dey pray, "Lord, heal doctors and government together." Because without health, all this political noise na vanity. Shey you understand? In the end, whether Trump threat, party jump, old general birthday, or climate appeal, na God's plan wey dey hold rope.

But here's the twist: if Tinubu fit calm Trump with diplomacy, maybe him fit tell doctors say "brothers, let's jingle bells instead of strike bells this Christmas." And if Sanwo-Olu wan investors, make him start by fixing one road without flood. As for Babangida, happy 84, sir – may your wisdom multiply like loaves and fishes. And Bayelsa governor, welcome to new team, but remember, true loyalty na to people, not logo.

Ultimately, my people, in this Naija we call home, wahala plenty, but joy still dey. We laugh to survive, pray to thrive. Even when threats loom or strikes bite, grace cover am all. So, as una dey enjoy this season, remember: politicians may switch, but God no dey change channel. And if anybody ask why we still dey stand, tell dem na because heaven promise better than any manifesto. Peace out, and merry Christmas – make una no let any Goliath spoil your feast.
