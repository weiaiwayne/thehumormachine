Eh, my people, imagine this governor from Bayelsa, sharp as a fresh okada rider dodging potholes, one day him dey solid with PDP, next morning him don flip straight to APC camp. Na so e be for our political game, e resemble those village wrestling matches where fighters switch sides mid-fight if the crowd cheers louder. You see am? Him reason say, why stay where the grass no dey green, when the other side don promise better pasture? And the party people dey hail am, as if e discover new juju for winning votes. Me sef, I dey wonder, if politicians fit jump ship dat fast, why una no fit jump from dat slow danfo wey dey crawl for morning rush? At least, for dat one, you go reach office before sunset.

Now, shift gear small, let us eye dis Anambra matter. Our main oga for Aso Rock, dem dey praise am for staying neutral, no pick side like referee wey no dey blow whistle for any team. Lagos APC people shout say na masterstroke, e show say power balance fine-fine. But wait o, neutral how? When elections dey hot like pepper soup wey you add too much uziza, and candidates dey scatter everywhere? E be like pastor wey dey preach peace to two fighting brothers, yet him pocket dey collect offering from both. Shey you get? Neutrality sweet when e no cost you votes, abi? If e were football match, dis neutrality go mean say referee allow own goal from both ends, and everybody go claim victory. Me, I prefer referee wey at least pretend to favor the underdog, make life no too boring.

Speaking to bigger wahala, dis American president, Trump, don open mouth threaten military action over here. Wetin? As if we no get enough drama with bandits and herders clashing like old rivals for market space. Our government summon all foreign envoys for Abuja, dey roll out red carpet with diplomatic sweet talk. And the response? Dem assure say na pure engagement, no shaking. E dey funny me die, because na so e be with these superpowers, dem dey act like big brother wey go discipline small pikin with belt, yet forget say we get our own juju doctors wey fit counter. You know dat feeling when uncle from abroad call to "advise" you on family issues, but him own house dey scatter? Exactly. Trump dey talk military, but if e land for our soil, e go first face mosquito army wey no dey respect passport. And our leaders dey respond calm-calm, as if e na small quarrel over who pays for amala. God bless dem for dat grace, because without prayer, dis kind threat fit turn to real thunder.

Ah, and dis Lagos state head, Sanwo-Olu, him don make appeal to global investors on climate change matter. Thursday meeting, e dey beg say come pour money for green projects, make we fight flood and heat wey dey punish us yearly. Na true talk, because rain for here no dey gentle, e come with anger like jilted lover, turn roads to river and market to swimming pool. But investors? Dem go hear am and reason, why risk capital for place where NEPA fit cut light mid-meeting? Yet, e inspiring small, see how him dey push for better tomorrow amid the chaos. Reminds me of Bible story where David face giant with simple stone, no fancy armor. Politicians fit promise heaven on earth with speeches, but true change come from faith wey move mountains, even if dem mountains be our endless potholes. Shey you feel me? If climate change na enemy, we go need more dan talk, we go need that divine intervention wey no dey fail, unlike those generators wey cough and die.

Now, let us no forget Babangida, the old general wey clock 84. Main oga congratulate am, say na milestone for the nation. E sweet to see elders wey see coups and transitions still standing tall, sharing wisdom from back days. But 84 for Naija? Dat mean you don survive more twists dan Nollywood plot, from military boots to civilian suits. Him story fit teach youth say endurance na key, especially when economy dey squeeze like lemon for juice. Unemployment dey bite hard, graduates dey hawk CV like pure water sellers for junction. Wetin dem do? Dem queue for jobs wey no exist, or start small hustle wey grow to empire. Me sef, I dey think, if Babangida fit rule and retire, why current crop no fit fix dis youth wahala before e turn to bigger fire? Yet, hope dey, because as Proverbs talk, the race no to the swift, but to dem wey endure with faith. Politicians fit shift like sand, but God's plan steady, e no dey change with election cycles.

Eh, and dis NNPC with Dangote refinery deal, dem dey negotiate to extend crude supply in naira, no more dollar wahala. Na step forward, because exchange rate dey dance kpalongo, make importers cry. Imagine, oil wey flow from our ground, now paid local currency, e fit ease pump price small. But wait, how e go play out? Refinery dey hum, yet queue for station still long like wedding reception line. Nigerians go celebrate first, then complain when e no reach everybody. E be our nature, quick to hail, quicker to roast. And for dat resident doctors strike, government dey move to end am, promise better pay amid health crisis. Doctors dey fight for rights, we patients dey pray make peace come fast, because hospital no be place for delay. Faith here sweet, as healer wey no need syringe, only word wey heal all.

My brothers and sisters, dis political circus dey spin, from party jumps to international bluff, climate pleas to elder honors. Yet, through the noise, we find way to laugh, because laughter na medicine wey no dey expire. Even when threats loom and pockets empty, grace cover us like umbrella for rain. Politicians fit play neutral or switch teams, but the ultimate referee up there no dey take bribe. So, keep hoping, keep hustling, and remember, in the end, joy come in the morning, no matter how long the night.
