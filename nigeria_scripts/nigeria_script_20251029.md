Ehen, my people, make una picture this: our President Tinubu dey jet off to France, shaking hands with Macron like say dem dey plan world domination over croissants and egusi soup. You know that meeting wey happen just now? E be like Tinubu go tell am, "Oga Macron, see how we dey hustle for this side, but your Eiffel Tower still dey shine pass our streetlights." And Macron, with him fancy accent, go nod and say, "Oui, but una oil dey make my cars run smooth." Na so dem go bond, while back home, we dey queue for garri like say e na Black Friday sale. But seriously, wetin be this? President dey globe-trot, but the wahala here no dey travel with am. Shey na strategy to dodge the heat, or e just wan show say Nigeria fit play with the big boys?

Now, shift gear small. You hear about this Fubara matter? The man wey suppose return as governor, but APC dey issue threats like say dem dey cast spell from village shrine. Uncertainty everywhere, e be like Nollywood plot wey no get ending. One day e dey, next day dem say no enter, make you park for junction. Imagine Fubara packing him bags, then hearing, "Oya, no come back, or else..." Or else wetin? Dem go send area boys with cutlasses? Na so politics turn to market banter, where everybody dey haggle for power like say e na bolt of Ankara cloth. And the people? We just dey watch, sipping zobo, waiting to see who go win the drama. But e sweet me say, in all this confusion, at least e remind us say life na like that—full of plot twists, but God's plan no dey shake like politician's promise.

Speaking of party wahala, wetin dey happen with PDP convention? Dem halt aspirants' screening like say na exam wey everybody cheat. Threatened gathering, e be like family reunion wey turn to fight over who chop the last piece of meat. Aspirants dey line up, then suddenly, "Stop! No enter!" Why now? Shey na fear say too many big men go show, and the place no fit contain their egos? Or maybe dem dey save money for generator, because if light cut, e go be like biblical darkness. You know, in times like this, e good to remember Proverbs—dem talk say wisdom na principal thing, but for Naija politics, e be like principal money wey dem dey share under table. So, PDP, take time, screen well well, because if una rush, na another round of regret go follow, like wedding rice wey finish before guest arrive.

Ah, and Senate President Akpabio? That man actions dey spark controversy faster than matchstick for dry grass. Every move, people dey talk, dey argue, like say him na celebrity wey post bad picture. One day e say this, next e do that, and boom—headlines everywhere. E be like Akpabio dey play chess with the whole country, but half the pieces na pawns wey no know their left from right. Controversy spark, then e calm, then spark again. Shey na intentional, to keep us entertained while real issues dey sleep? Or e just happen say power no dey come with manual? Me, I think say e like that verse in James—tongue dey small, but e fit set fire. Akpabio tongue and actions na wildfire, burning through headlines, but hopefully, e go lead to some good harvest, not just smoke.

Now, let me yarn una about this energy investment wey Nigeria secure—$8 billion! E sound like jackpot from Baba Ijebu, abi? Big money pouring in, promise of light, power, everything wey go make life sweet. But wait first, who dey cash this cheque? Dem talk say e go fix the sector, but last time we hear such talk, e turn to promise wey fade like morning dew. Imagine: generators quiet, AC blowing cold, no more sweating like say you dey run marathon for harmattan. $8 billion na serious figure, e fit build bridges, schools, even pay salaries without wahala. Yet, I dey fear say, e go be like that prodigal son story—money come, scatter, then we beg for more. But on the bright side, if e work, na testimony! God's grace go multiply am, turn scarcity to abundance, like loaves and fishes for multitude.

And oh, this NNPC and Dangote Refinery talk—extending naira-based crude supply deal. E be like business meeting wey turn to romance, "Oya, let's keep this going, use our own money, no dollar wahala." Smart move, shey? Instead of begging abroad, we dey trade with ourselves, like market women haggling over tomatoes. But picture the refinery humming, pumping out fuel, and prices drop small. No more long queues, no more black market drama. E go be like manna from heaven, especially now wey everything cost pass gold. Yet, I laugh say, if dem extend too much, naira go weak like overcooked yam. But faith say, hold on, redemption dey come—maybe this deal na the miracle wey go refine our economy, not just the crude.

That tourist asking how to get from Abuja to Kano without flying? E be like person wey wan experience the real Naija adventure. Road trip, abi? Through the dust, potholes jumping like frog for rainy season. Bus wey stop every five minutes for "nature call," or driver wey dey play gospel music to ward off armed robbers. "How can I?" E easy: pack pepper soup for the journey, pray for no breakdown, and enjoy the views of villages wey time forget. But seriously, tourist, welcome—e no be smooth like Paris metro, but e teach you resilience, that Nigerian spirit wey no dey tire. And if you reach, testify say, even in the bumps, God's protection na the best GPS.

Extraordinary Nigerian teen from Lagos? That kid dey blow mind, doing things wey make you shake head in wonder. Small boy, big talent, like David with sling against Goliath. E inspire, show say youth no dey wait for spoon—dem create their own. In a country where unemployment dey chase people like shadow, this one dey shine. Makes you think, if one kid fit, wetin stop the rest? Maybe na the politicians wey dey hoard opportunities. But with faith, e possible—Philippians talk say, I can do all things through Christ. So, kid, keep pushing; you na hope for the generation.

And this "crazy things are happening" vibe? Everywhere, from senate to streets, e full. Funny but true, like meme wey hit too close. Nigeria na theater, with us as audience and actors. One minute, president meet service chiefs in Aso Rock, updating strategies like war room for village. Tinubu convene, chiefs align, promise security. But outside, petty thieves still dey operate. E be like, fix the big picture, small picture go follow. Yet, in the mix, we find humor—because if we no laugh, tears go flood the place. And grace? E dey there, whispering that after storm, rainbow come.

Even this "how can I help Nigerian Christians" question—e touch heart. In a land where faith strong pass iron, but persecution dey sneak like snake. Help by praying, supporting, standing firm. Like Ephesians armor, we wear it daily. No be easy, but with Jesus as anchor, we no sink. Politicians come and go, but that hope eternal.

Wrapping this up, my people, from France handshakes to refinery deals, Naija dey move, but sometimes in circles. Yet, through the spin, one thing sure: laughter na medicine, and faith na the cure. So, next time wahala knock, open with joke, close with prayer. Because if Tinubu fit meet Macron, we fit meet our breakthroughs. And that, una, na the real power play.
