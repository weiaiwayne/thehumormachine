Eh, my people, picture this: one governor from Bayelsa, that oil-rich spot where the rivers flow like money should but never does, suddenly decides to jump ship from PDP straight to APC. Na so e be? One day you're red, next day you're green and white, chasing that power like it's the last plate of pounded yam at a village wedding. I mean, wetin dey happen? These politicians dey treat parties like old clothes – if e no fit again, you dash am give tailor make e turn am to something new. And the people? We just dey watch, shaking our heads, wondering if this switch go bring better roads or just more potholes disguised as election promises. Shey you sabi that feeling when your brother changes sides in a family argument just to eat the bigger share of the inheritance? Exactly, that's our politics – survival of the quickest to flip.

Now, speaking of flips, let's talk about this matter with that American fellow, Trump, threatening to send soldiers over some border drama. Our own oga at the top summons all the diplomats in Abuja, assuring everybody say na diplomatic talk e go be, no wahala. But come, who send am? As if we no get enough soldiers patrolling our own streets for ghosts and bandits. Imagine Yankee boys marching into our markets, asking for directions to the next checkpoint while we dey explain say the real enemy na hunger wey dey bite harder than any bullet. And the response? "We're engaging diplomatically." Engaging ke? Like say na football match where we go negotiate own goal. Me, I dey laugh because even in the Bible, David no need foreign army to face Goliath; e just pick stone and trust God go guide the throw. So why we dey beg outsiders when our own faith suppose be the shield?

That brings me to these doctors wey don strike again, folding arms while patients dey wait like passengers for a delayed flight from heaven. Government say dem go end am, but how? With more meetings or actual pay wey fit buy stethoscope without begging? You ever think about it – we dey rush to hospital when fever catch us, but the healers themselves dey fight for salary like market women haggling over tomato price. Na wa o. One time, my cousin fall sick, doctor check am quick-quick, prescribe medicine, then strike start next day. E be like God dey test us: heal thyself first, then heal thy neighbor. But seriously, if doctors no work, who go attend to these politicians when dem catch malaria from too much traveling? Maybe na time for divine intervention, because man's promises dey expire faster than yogurt in Lagos heat.

And oya, let's not forget this U-turn on that 15% tariff for fuel imports. Yesterday, e dey, today e no dey – poof, like magician wey hide the rabbit. Economy supposed stabilize, but instead, prices jump up and down more than Okada rider dodging traffic. Wetin be dis? Policy makers dey change mind like weather in harmattan season, one minute hot, next cold. The ordinary man? We just dey adjust belt tighter, praying for grace to stretch the little we get. Remember how Joseph in the Bible stored grain for seven lean years? Our leaders suppose learn that – plan ahead, no dey flip like akara in hot oil. But no, dem prefer the drama, keeping us guessing if tomorrow go better or if we go need to farm our own petrol from backyard.

Shifting gears, I hear say the man in charge of our commercial hub dey appeal to global investors on climate change, talking big about green energy and sustainable whatever at some international event. Beautiful words, eh? But back home, floods dey swallow communities, and we're still burning generators like it's festival time. Shey na only for camera dem dey preach this gospel of earth care? Imagine investors coming, seeing our potholes filled with rainwater, thinking it's a new swimming trend. We need that money to fix real things – bridges wey no collapse during rainy season, or forests wey no turn to timber market overnight. And faith wise, the Good Book talk say stewards of the earth must care proper, not just pose for pictures. If we no act, who go save the children from rising waters? Not the politicians wey promise paradise but deliver flood alerts.

You know, all this political circus dey remind me of how we Nigerians hustle daily. Take unemployment – government dey talk about tackling am with foreign help, but what about the youth wey graduate with degrees hotter than jollof but no job in sight? Dem dey turn to 419 schemes or street vending, praying for breakthrough. One boy I know, sharp as knife, apply for jobs everywhere, end up selling recharge cards under bridge. E tell me, "Brother, even Bible say faith without work na dead, so I dey work faith with this small stand." True talk. We no need threats from abroad or party hops; we need vision wey stick, leaders wey no dey U-turn every bend.

Then there's this noise about Igbos in the commercial city feeling like one nation na illusion. Tensions high, like pot of soup wey dey boil over. But come, aren't we all in the same boat, paddling through economic storms? Politicians dey fan the flames for votes, but we the people? We intermarry, share garri, laugh at same Nollywood twists. Shey no be time to remember that grace unites, not divides? Even Paul in scriptures talk about breaking walls between tribes. If we no, who go enjoy the peace when wahala finish?

And this deal between the national oil company and that big refinery, extending supply in local currency – sounds smart on paper, saving dollars like miser hiding cowries. But will it trickle down to us, or just fill more private jets? We dey watch, hoping say this time, the money no leak like faulty pipe. In the end, my people, through all this madness, hold on to that unshakeable hope – the one from above wey no dey fail, even when humans do. Because if politicians no deliver, at least heaven's promise na sure banker.

Finally, imagine if Trump really sends those troops, and they meet our own soldiers debating in Pidgin – "Oga, wetin you dey find here? Go face your own wall!" We'd turn invasion to comedy show, and the world go learn say Naija spirit no dey break easy. But God forbid, abi? Let's pray for wisdom all around, and keep laughing to stay sane.
