Eh, my people, picture this scenario wey dey play out like some Nollywood script gone wrong. You wake up, check your phone, and bam, the man from the White House, that orange-haired fellow, dey yarn say him fit send troops come scatter things here. Military action? For wetin na? Shey na because of some border wahala or just him dey feel like playing cowboy again? And our side, dem summon all those foreign envoys to Abuja, like say na emergency family meeting. Diplomats from everywhere, China, UK, even Russia, all squeezed into one room, sipping tea and pretending say everything dey under control. Me, I dey laugh, because if na true say soldier wan land, first thing dem go meet na traffic jam wey fit make dem regret the flight. Imagine Yankee boys in camouflage, stuck behind okada riders and loaded trailers, shouting orders while sweating under this harmattan sun.

Now, shift gear small, talk about that oga from the oil-rich state down south. One day him dey rock the opposition colors, next thing, him don jump ship to the ruling party, like say na prom night and him change outfit mid-dance. Bayelsa matter, abi? The man dump the old crew and join the new one, hailing the big boss for staying neutral in some other state affair. Neutrality, ehn? That word sweet pass honey for mouth, but in our clime, e mean say you dey watch from sidelines while others dey fight. And the cheers from the party faithful, dem dey celebrate like say him bring home World Cup trophy. But wait, wetin happen to loyalty? Na like market women wey switch stall when better customer show face. If politics na business, then this one na sharp practice, the type wey make you wonder if manifesto na just wrapping paper for empty promises.

That one remind me of another angle, this time with the former soldier-turned-leader turning another year wiser. Eighty-four candles, and the current headman send greetings, full of respect and nostalgia. Babangida at 84, still sharp, still influencing from the shadows. Congratulate am, say him legacy dey shine like morning star. But e get that irony, especially with all this talk of external threats. Military past meeting present drama, like old generals reminiscing over fufu while young ones dey plot next move. And in the mix, our leaders dey assure say diplomacy go handle am, no wahala. But deep down, you know say in this part of the world, threats come and go like rainy season showers, but we still dey stand, thanks to that unshakeable faith that keeps us going. Even when storms gather, remember the good book talks of peace that passeth understanding, no be by arms or accords.

Speaking of standing firm, let's touch on this push to wrap up the doctors' strike. Resident physicians folding arms, hospitals turning to ghost towns, patients queuing like for black market rice. And the appeals flying left and right, promising talks and resolutions. End the impasse, they say, before the whole system collapse like faulty bridge. Imagine, you go hospital for malaria, come out with more wahala because nobody on ground. It's that daily grind wey test our patience, but also show say resilience na our middle name. We pray for healing, not just for bodies, but for the system too, because grace cover multitude of errors, even when negotiations drag like snail race.

Now, zoom out to the international stage, where our man at the top meet with World Bank bosses, yarn about loans and development. Abuja sessions, full of charts and handshakes, promising better days. But then, replies to those global money lenders, saying their timelines too tight, like asking sprinter to run marathon in seconds. Fix economy in two years? Abeg, na joke. Our challenges deep-rooted, from youth idleness to uneven projects that favor some zones over others. Shey na bias or strategy? Whispers say some initiatives smell like favoritism, as if the focus na one corner of the map. And the voices from the east, calling out the mirage of unity, like sandcastles washing away with tide. Igbos in the mix, feeling sidelined, yet we all in same boat, paddling through choppy waters.

That energy carry over to the climate summit vibes, where the state head in the commercial hub make plea to investors. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, appealing for green funds, talking adaptation and sustainability. Renewed call, Thursday gathering, all eyes on turning heat into opportunity. But in reality, our streets flood every rainy day, markets turn to swimming pools, and we dey improvise with buckets and prayers. Global investors, come o, pour money into this resilience. It's absurd, innit? While world dey worry carbon footprints, we dey battle actual floods and heat waves without AC. Yet, there's that biblical nod – stewards of the earth, turning trials to triumphs through wisdom from above.

And don't get me started on the refinery talks, NNPC linking arms with private giant for local deals, extending crude in naira terms. Talks ongoing, aiming to cut dollar dance. Sounds smart, but execution? That's the million-dollar question, or should I say naira puzzle. If it works, prices might ease, but if not, more queues and grumbles. Nigerians, we adapt, always finding silver lining, even when clouds thick. Faith in the mix, believing that provision comes from higher source, not just pipelines.

One more twist, this departure for overseas trips – Japan, Brazil, scouting partnerships. Thursday flight, leaving domestic fires to simmer. While away, we hold fort, whispering prayers for safe journeys and fruitful outcomes. Because in the end, no matter the headlines, it's the everyday faith that anchors us, turning potential chaos to comedy gold.

Eh, but seriously, if Trump really sends those boys, tell dem to bring dollars, because our exchange rate go make dem broke before first patrol. And as for party switchers, next time, at least send memo, no be ambush. We go survive, with laughter as weapon and grace as shield. Peace out, my people – may your lights stay on, even if it's candlelight vigil.
