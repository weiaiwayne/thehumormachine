Oya, good evening everybody! How una dey? Lagos heat don finish us all, abi? Even the NEPA sef is on sabbatical. I swear, generator manufacturers are the real politicians in this country – always providing “power” when the government fails.

So, I was scrolling through Reddit this morning, ehn? One guy just wrote, "I think about suicide a lot but I have no one to talk to." Ah! Nigeria, we need to do better. We’re laughing at memes, but people are actually suffering. This country will stress you to early grave.

Then I see another post, "Why are Igbo-Americans so loud?" Loud keh? Maybe because they're making noise for those of us who are suffering in silence here! Make dem carry go, diaspora dey represent. My cousin Kene, lives in Atlanta, he sends better dollar rates than CBN. True story!

Nairaland is another level entirely. You go there, and you think you're reading a political analysis, then suddenly, boom! tribal war erupts. Everybody becomes an expert on everything. I swear, if Nigeria was a person, Nairaland would be its perpetually arguing conscience.

And speaking of politics, Tinubu... Baba is trying, I will give him that. Trying to break the country, maybe. All these economic policies? My brother, I went to buy bread the other day, and the baker asked if I wanted a mortgage plan with it. *Wait, what?* Bread has become investment property!

They said subsidy is gone, fuel is free...free to finish our pockets! Before, I could at least afford to *think* about driving my car. Now, I’m considering trekking from Lekki to Ikeja. Exercise, they call it. I call it government-sponsored suffering.

Remember those promises during election? "I will give you heaven on earth!" Now we are looking for earth self, we no see. They promised us jobs, now we are all entrepreneurs. Everyone is selling something online. If you are not selling something in Lagos, my friend, you are the product!

I saw a post about the Igbo festival in London. Enfield, dem dey do am. You see why I said diaspora is important? They are preserving the culture while we are busy arguing about who will be president in 2027. 2027? My brother, I'm just trying to survive till next week!

But seriously, what's the plan for 2027? It’s like a Nigerian wedding – we know it's coming, we know there will be drama, plenty food will be wasted, and at the end of the day, we'll still complain.

You know, I was stuck in traffic on Third Mainland Bridge last week, sweating like a Christmas goat. I looked around and saw everyone with that same Lagos face – tired, frustrated, but somehow… resilient. We are a special breed, we Nigerians. We complain, we suffer, but we still find a way to laugh.

And that’s why I’m here tonight. To laugh with you, about us, before the government gives us another reason to cry. Because if we don’t laugh, we’ll just end up like that guy on Reddit, thinking about things we shouldn’t be thinking about. So, let’s laugh… before they increase the price of laughter too!
