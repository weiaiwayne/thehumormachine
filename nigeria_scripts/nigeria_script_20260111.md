My brothers and sisters, imagine waking up to news wey scatter person brain – this American president over there, Donald Trump, don open mouth threaten say him go send soldiers come scatter our peace here. Ehn, na so? As if say na movie script dem dey act, but this one na real life wahala wey fit turn to blockbuster. You see, our leaders no waste time; dem summon every foreign ambassador for that capital city, like say na emergency family meeting. Dem gather dem, tell dem say we no dey fear, we dey handle am diplomatically. But me I dey ask, which kind diplomacy be this one wey start with phone calls and end with prayers? Shey una know say even Bible talk say peace come through wisdom, no be through big big threats from across the ocean. Anyway, dem say our president respond calm, assure everybody say na talk talk, but deep down, I know say plenty people for market dey wonder if dem go need to stock up on extra garri before any soldier boot land.

Now, picture this switch-up wey happen for that riverine state, Bayelsa. The governor there, him don dump that old party wey him been dey follow, now him cross over join the ruling one. Ehn, na like person wey dey tire of pepper soup, now switch to eba steady. Politicians and their moves, e no dey tire! One day na opposition, next day na ally, all in name of better tomorrow. But tell me, which kind better tomorrow be this wey start with jumping ship? My uncle wey dey village always yarn say, loyalty na like good juju – once you lose am, na to find new one begin. And while dem dey hail am for the new side, I dey think of those doctors wey dey strike, wey government now dey promise to settle to end the hold-up. Na so? Doctors fold arm because salary no dey flow, patient dey suffer, but now dem say peace go reign. E sweet my heart, because even for Scripture, healing come when leaders step up with justice, no be with empty promises wey blow like harmattan wind.

Speaking of leaders stepping up, you hear how our number one man send greetings to that old military head, Babangida, as him clock 84? Congratulate am on long life, say him still dey inspire. Inspire who? Those of us wey dey hustle daily? Ehn, at 84, the man still dey there, sharp as ever, but me I dey wonder – with all this threat from abroad and party hopping inside, shey inspiration no go come from facing current storm first? Na like celebrating birthday while roof dey leak. But God bless old soldiers, dem see plenty battle, and still stand. Reminds me of that verse wey talk say gray hair na crown of glory, if dem come through righteous living. Maybe na lesson for our current crew – endure, fight fair, and let wisdom lead, no be muscle from faraway land.

Now, let me yarn una about this appeal wey come from the helmsman of our commercial hub. Him gather global investors, talk say come put money for climate change fight, make we green up the place. Renewed call, e sound good on paper, but while dem dey pitch for foreign cash, people for street dey face flood wey no respect calendar. Ehn, climate change na real, but shey na only when investor dey around dem remember? My sister wey sell vegetable for corner always complain say rain go fall uninvited, spoil her ware, and no generator to dry am quick. No be so? Yet, in all this, I find small hope – because faith teach say even in storm, there go be rainbow after. Politicians fit promise green future, but true change come when heart dey right, like that parable of sower wey plant good seed.

And e no stop there; you see this talk between our national oil company and that big refinery owner, dem dey negotiate to keep supplying crude with our local currency, no more dollar wahala. Extend the deal, make things smooth. Na step forward, abi? But in Nigeria, every step forward na like dance with two left feet – one moment smooth, next one stumble. People dey happy say naira go save, but unemployment still dey bite hard, youth dey roam street like lost sheep. Government yarn say dem dey tackle am with USA partners, but me I dey wait see action, no be just meeting. Reminds me how family gather for Christmas, promise better year, but come January, na same old grind. Yet, grace dey sufficient, as Paul for Bible talk – even when economy tight, God's provision no dry up.

That one time, I remember my cousin wey graduate with first class, now him dey drive okada because job no dey. E pain, but him laugh say na temporary, say God go open door. So when I hear of this IMF advice wey our side reply say no realistic to fix everything in two years, I nod head. True talk! Rome no build in day, and Nigeria no go sort overnight. Dem say unrealistic, but una know say for our side, two years na eternity – election cycle dey fast. But here's deeper truth: redemption no quick fix, e take time, like potter molding clay. Politicians fit rush, but faith patient.

Now, e get this noise about lopsided projects, people asking if the top man na for whole country or just one zone. Allegation fly, say focus too much on home base. Ehn, na so life be – sometimes favoritism show face, but unity na the goal. Igbos for that bustling city yarn say one nation na illusion, but me I believe say with dialogue, bridge go build. No be fight, na family matter. And for coexistence, that speech from the state boss talk say we challenged, but possible. True, my people – like prodigal son story, wayward but always welcome back.

Even with all this, Nigerian spirit no die. You see that extraordinary teen wey dey make wave, or the drummer wey confess him life story? Na the heart wey push forward. And for food, ranking dem no end – from pounded yam to suya, e dey unite us. But poverty dey shadow, market life hard, family dynamics test everybody. Yet, in church, we sing say joy come in morning, and that na the anchor.

One more thing: this fellow Nigerian brother meme wey dey trend, full of laugh emoji, e capture us – resilient, funny even in mess. Shey you feel me? So as Trump threaten and parties shift, doctors resume, investors eye, and old heroes celebrate, we go keep pushing. Because at end, no military boot or diplomatic summon fit quench our fire. Only grace sustain, and that na eternal. Peace!
