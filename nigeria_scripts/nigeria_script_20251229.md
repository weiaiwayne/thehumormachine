Eh, my brothers and sisters, make una hold una belle make e no pain una as I dive into this fresh madness wey dey happen for our side. You see this Bayelsa matter, where the oga for there suddenly decide say PDP don tire am, so him jump fence go APC like say na new jollof recipe wey dem find. Chai, politicians for Naija, dem be like chameleons wey change color every season, one day red, next day green, and we dey clap say e sweet. Imagine o, him wake up one morning, look mirror, say "Ah, this party no dey pay salary again, make I go where the rice dey plenty." And the crowd? Dem hail am like hero, as if e no be the same man wey yesterday dey curse the other side. Shey una see how we dey? Even when dem switch, we still dey believe say na progress, like say APC na automatic promotion to heaven. But wait, e be like say party loyalty na like old phone, once battery low, you change am sharp sharp without remorse.

Now, talking of old things wey no wan die, see President Tinubu wey go wish former military head Babangida happy 84th birthday. 84 o! That man don see more coups than I don see stable electricity, and him still dey sharp like fresh kola nut. Tinubu send message say "Congratulations, you still dey strong," and I dey think, strong ke? Baba IBB don turn living legend, the kind wey history books no fit close. Remember how him rule back then, with that gap-tooth smile wey fit charm snake? Now at 84, him dey collect goodwill like collector plate, while we young ones dey hustle for survival. E be like say our leaders no wan hand over, dem dey think say age na just number, but for real, at 84, most people dey plan burial, no be birthday bash. And Tinubu, wey him self no be small boy, dey congratulate like say dem dey race for longest life award. Abi, maybe na strategy, keep the old guards happy so dem no cough and scatter the peace. But me, I dey pray say God give una all long life, because if dem go, who go teach us how to dodge wahala like pros? Even Bible talk say wisdom come with gray hair, so perhaps na why dem still dey shine – not muscle, but sense wey time polish.

Shifting gear small, this doctors strike wey dem wan end, ehn, na another episode for our endless health drama. Government say dem dey move to stop am, like say na simple off switch for generator. But wetin you go tell patient wey dey wait for operation, only to hear "Doctors don comot, go find herbalist"? Our hospitals be like market where everybody dey negotiate, but when strike hit, na full lockdown. Imagine o, you get fever, go clinic, dem say "Sorry, we on break, try paracetamol and prayer." And prayer sef, e work, but e no replace syringe. Government promise say dem go fix am, but how many times dem talk that one? E be like our promises from leaders – plenty talk, small action. Shey you know that feeling when you dey queue for medicine, only for light to cut, and you start to wonder if na curse or just normal Naija life. But thank God for grace, because even when human systems fail, divine healing no dey take holiday. Dem doctors deserve better pay, no doubt, but make una quick settle before we turn to full-time prophets for cure.

And speaking of settling, see this Sanwo-Olu wey dey appeal to global investors for climate change matter. Him stand there Thursday, yarn say Lagos need funds to fight flood and heat, like say na new movie pitch. "Come invest, we go build green walls," him talk, and I dey laugh because last time rain fall, half the city turn river, danfo dey swim like fish. Investors from abroad dey listen, probably thinking "This place sweet, but wetin be this?" Sanwo-Olu paint picture of eco-friendly future, but on ground, we still dey battle plastic everywhere and potholes wey hold water like dam. E be like say him dey sell dream to oyinbo, while we locals dey mop floor from last flood. Climate change na real palava, no cap, with heat wey dey melt brain faster than ice block. But make him first fix the basics – bridges wey no collapse, roads wey no swallow cars – before him call for big money. And the gospel truth? Even as world dey heat up, God's promise of seasons no change; him dey control the rain, not politicians wey dey promise umbrella but deliver sieve.

Now, let me touch this NNPC and Dangote refinery talk, where dem dey extend deal to supply crude with naira, no more dollar wahala. Sounds good on paper, like say na breakthrough for our oil game. Dangote, that business shark, dey smile because him refinery go run smooth, and government dey pat self back say na economic win. But wait, how many times dem announce such deals, only for queue at pump to laugh back? Refinery dey, but fuel price still dey dance azonto, up today, down tomorrow, confuse everybody. Nigerians dey hope say this one go tame inflation, make garri affordable again, but experience teach say hope alone no fill belle. E be like marrying rich wife – you think say poverty don end, but bills still come. And with all this, unemployment still dey bite hard, youth wey graduate dey hawk pure water instead of office. Government yarn say dem dey tackle am with USA help, but wetin be the plan? More seminars or real jobs? Igbos for Lagos dey complain say one Naija na illusion, with projects wey favor some sides more than others. Is Tinubu running Naija or just him backyard? Chai, the balance na delicate, like jenga tower wey one wrong move scatter everything.

You see, this our coexistence na challenged thing, as Sanwo-Olu himself talk. From Bayelsa switch to birthday cheers, strikes to climate calls, e be like scriptwriter dey high on something. Politicians promise paradise, but deliver pothole heaven, and we dey manage with faith and fufu. Even IMF say fix problems no be two years work, and Tinubu reply say na unrealistic, which na true – our issues deep like Pacific. But here's the beauty: in all this chaos, grace dey shine through, reminding us that true change come from above, not just from Aso Rock. So make we laugh am off, because if we no laugh, tears go finish tissue. And if Trump still dey threaten with military talk, make him know say Naija spirit no break easy – we don survive worse than Yankee drama. In the end, as long as we hold Bible and belle laugh, we go win this race. Peace out, my people – stay blessed!
