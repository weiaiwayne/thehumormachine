Ah, my people, you ever notice how our leaders dey plan these big international handshakes like say na market bargaining for Onitsha? Take this latest gist about our president heading over to chat with that American big shot, the one with the wild hair and tweets that scatter everywhere. E be like say dem wan discuss insecurity, but wetin I dey wonder be this: if dem fit share tips on building walls, maybe na to keep bandits out or just to block bad news from reaching the villa. Shey you sabi? One side, dem dey talk peace, other side, our villages dey turn into ghost towns faster than empty plate after Christmas rice. But e sweet me say at least dem go snap pictures, post am for social media, make we feel like say progress dey load like MTN airtime.

Now, talking about loading things, make I yarn you about this hunger wahala up north. E no be joke o, dem dey do documentary on empty pots and children wey belly dey cry louder than mosque call to prayer. You know that feeling when you wake up, check pocket, see only lint and regret from yesterday's suya? Multiply that by million for families wey no see three square meals since last harvest. Politicians dey promise fertilizer like say na free sample from church giveaway, but e end up like those fake prophets wey sell holy water wey taste like gutter runoff. Me, I dey think, if hunger na enemy, why no fight am with real weapons – like turning those vast lands into farms instead of grazing grounds for cows wey dey spark farmer-herder palava every season. Abi, or maybe invite some of those foreign investors wey dey eye our oil to come plant seeds instead of just sucking ground dry.

Ehen, and speaking of investors, una hear say we don secure eight billion dollars for energy projects? Eight billion! That na money wey fit buy every danfo bus in Oshodi and still have change to fix potholes from here to Calabar. But wait first, wetin be energy for this context? No be the one wey NEPA dey tease us with, two hours light per week, then darkness swallow everything like jealous ex. No, this one na big talk about solar panels, wind farms, maybe even those fancy batteries wey hold power like camel dey hold water. I imagine dem installing panels on rooftops in Maiduguri, so even when sun dey beat like angry landlord, at least fan go turn and cool the sweat. But my worry be say, with our sharp guys wey fit divert funds faster than pickpocket for crowded bus, that eight billion go reach ground level or vanish like morning dew? Shey dem go use am to light up schools so kids fit study without kerosene lamp wey dey cough smoke into eyes, or na just another promise wey go expire like expired sachet water under hot sun?

That reminds me of this other matter, the one about helping our Christian brothers and sisters across the land. You know how e be, in a country wey every corner get place of worship competing for airwaves – mosques blaring, churches chorusing, shrines whispering. But when trouble knock, like floods in Benue or clashes in Plateau, e no dey matter which god you call, everybody just wan survive. I dey laugh because some oga for abroad dey ask, how to send aid, and I think, start by teaching dem to weave baskets like our mamas, so when rain fall and river swallow homes, at least food fit stay dry. Or better, share stories from the good book, like that one about manna from heaven, but make am practical – no be waiting for miracle when irrigation canal dey possible. E sweet pass to see unity, you know? Muslims sharing iftar with neighbors, Christians inviting for Sunday rice, turning division into community pot wey everybody chop from. But politicians wan chop the pot first, abi? Dem fault that American leader for talking down on us, calling our issues misleading, but e be like mirror no lie – when your house dey leak, no blame the rain, fix the roof with the billions you claim to have.

Wetin dey pain me most na this refinery deal extension, where dem wan keep supplying crude with our own currency instead of dollars wey dey scarce like good roads. Imagine, NNPC and that big plant owner shaking hands again, saying na to save foreign exchange, but e sound like family business wey one brother dey owe the other goat from last yuletide. You sabi how e go be? Prices go steady small, but then queue for pump go twist like Lagos bridge traffic, everybody pushing to fill jerry cans before hike come again. Me, I dey pray say e work, because nothing dey humble person like trekking to work when bike no get petrol. And in that prayer, I remember that grace wey no dey run out, the one wey Jesus talk about, feeding five thousand with loaves and fish. If only our leaders fit multiply fuel like that, or turn water to clean energy, then we no go need these endless talks. But na so life be, we hustle, we hope, and we laugh to keep from crying.

Now, shift gear small to this Igbos in the commercial city matter, where some dey claim one united front na dream wey no go wake. E be like saying, why blend when you fit shine separate? But look, in market, Igbo trader go sell to Yoruba buyer, Hausa tailor go stitch for all, and by evening, dem dey share pepper soup under same lantern. That mirage talk na for those wey no see the rainbow after rain. And about lopsided projects, shey na favoritism or just say some places need more love like prodigal son? Our oga at top dey meet world bank chiefs, promising reforms, but e feel like borrowing from future to patch today, and tomorrow go ask for interest with high yen. Japan and Brazil next on the travel list, e be like shopping tour – learn tech from one, agriculture from other, but come back with suitcase full of ideas wey gather dust like old calendar.

Ehen, and this drummer confession wey dey trend, guy yarn say life behind the beat na sweat and no pay, pounding goatskin till hand cramp, but crowd dey dance like say na free show. Relate am to us all – we dey drum for survival, beating rhythms of resilience in face of hunger, darkness, division. But in that beat, there na hope note, the one from scripture wey say endure and inherit the promise. No be easy, but e possible, like crossing Third Mainland without accident when driver sober.

One more thing before I wrap this yarn, this coexistence challenge wey even state helmsman dey address. Dangerous spots plenty, from bustling streets to quiet villages, but wetin make am tick na the spirit wey no surrender. We rank our foods high – pounded yam over amala any day – but if pot no boil, ranking no fill belly. So, to all wey dey lead, remember that grace wey redeems, the one wey turn wilderness to garden. And for us, keep the wit sharp, the faith stronger, because in the end, laughter na the best weapon against the storm. If politicians no deliver, at least Jesus no dey default on promises – eternal life no get fine print!
