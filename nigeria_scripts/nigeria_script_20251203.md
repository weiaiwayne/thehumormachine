Wetin dey happen for this our country sef, e be like say politicians don turn Nollywood script writers, always twisting plot wey no dey make sense. Imagine, one governor from Bayelsa just wake up one morning and say, enough of this PDP wahala, I dey cross over to APC like say na river Jordan we dey talk about. E no be say e see milk and honey for the other side, na just the usual game of musical chairs where the music stops and everybody scramble for the same old seat. Shey you understand? Dem go dump party today, join another tomorrow, and by next week, e go be like e never left the first one. Na so dem dey preserve power, abi? But me, I dey wonder, if all these governors dey change jerseys like football players, when e go be time for dem to score goals for us the fans wey dey suffer?

That one dey remind me of this Anambra matter wey dem hail our big oga for staying neutral. Neutral ke? Like say e be Switzerland for inside Naija politics. Lagos APC people dey clap for am, say e no pick side for that election palava. But wait o, neutrality for politician na like referee wey dey blow whistle for both teams at once – e no go end well. You know how it is, one side go win, the other go cry foul, and before you know, e go turn to full market fight with egusi soup flying everywhere. And us? We just dey watch from the side, hoping say the winner go at least fix the roads wey turn to Olympic hurdles every rainy season. But neutrality? E be like promise from politician – sounds good, but e no last pass five minutes.

Eh, but the real drama wey dey make my head spin na this talk about foreign big man threatening to send soldiers our way. Some Yankee leader, Trump, dey yarn say military action fit land for Naija, and our government just summon all diplomats to Abuja like say na emergency aso-ebi meeting. Dem dey talk diplomacy, assuring everybody say dem get am under control. Under control? Chai, if control na the thing, why our borders still dey leak like old umbrella for harmattan? Imagine, one foreign power dey eye us like we be some rogue state from action movie, and our response na "hold on, make we chat." Chat about wetin? The fact say we still dey import rice wey our farmers fit plant, or the queues wey turn to war zone every time fuel price jump? No be say I blame dem, but e be like say dem forget say Naija no dey take threats lightly – we go counter with prayer warrior mode, binding and casting from every church corner. Even Bible talk say greater is He that is in us, so maybe dem Yankees go think twice before dem try that one.

Speaking of things wey dey need divine intervention, see this U-turn on that 15 percent fuel import tariff. Government announce am one day, next day dem flip like pancake on hot frying pan. Wetin happen? Dem realize say if dem push that, the suffering go multiply like yeast for akara batter. Nigerians go wake up to higher transport fare, market women go add extra on top of their yams, and danfo drivers go turn highway robbers just to cover cost. So dem back off, and everybody dey breathe small relief. But tell me, if policy na yo-yo wey dem dey play up and down, how we go trust say any plan go stick? E be like marriage where the husband promise fidelity, then two weeks later e dey eye neighbor's daughter. No stability, just wahala. And in the midst of it, we still dey queue for ATM, praying say the machine no swallow our card like Jonah for whale belly. But grace dey, sha – even when plans fail, God's timing no dey ever miss.

Now, let me yarn you about this doctors' strike wey dem dey move to end. Resident doctors don fold arms for long, hospitals dey look like ghost towns, and patients dey turn to herbalists or just endure the pain like say na fasting season. Government finally step in, promising to settle the matter. Settle how? With the same money wey dem dey chop from taxes wey we barely fit pay? E no funny, but e be like comedy show where the hero always shows up late after the villain don scatter everything. You know that feeling when you dey rush to clinic for malaria, only to find say the place empty, and the only treatment na aspirin from roadside chemist? That's our reality, mixed with hope say one day, e go better. Reminds me of that Bible story where Jesus heal the sick without needing strike notice or budget approval – if only our leaders fit learn that kind of efficiency, abi?

But wait, e no stop there. Our oga at the top don go meet World Bank chiefs in Abuja, probably begging for loan wey go fix the economy or at least buy some breathing space. Dem dey talk about tackling unemployment, but shey una see how graduates dey hawk pure water for traffic instead of sitting in office? E be like say the jobs dem promise na like mirage for Sahara – you dey approach, e disappear. And now with this refinery deal between NNPC and Dangote, extending naira payment for crude, e sound like small win. At last, something wey no involve dollar wahala. But me, I dey fear say e go turn to another long story where the oil no reach the kitchen, and we still dey fry plantain with generator fuel. Nigerians resilient sha, we go improvise, turn empty pots to music instruments, and dance through the struggle. Even Paul for Bible talk say in everything, give thanks – so we dey thank God say at least the sun still dey rise, even if the power no dey.

That one bring me to this Igbo people for Lagos matter, where dem say one Nigeria na illusion. Chai, deep talk o. Politicians dey build projects wey look like dem favor one side, and people dey murmur say e be like say the president na governor for only one state. Lopsided, dem call am. But wetin you expect when the center no hold? E be like family gathering where the father share meat and give all to his favorite child, while others dey eye the bones. In Lagos, the most dangerous state? Dangerous how? From okada riders wey fly like eagles or the traffic wey swallow your whole day? We dey coexist by grace, blending tribes like ingredients for egusi soup – sometimes e curdle, but with prayer, e come together sweet.

And see this former military man, Babangida, turning 84, with congratulations pouring in. The man wey rule with iron fist now dey collect birthday wishes like grandpa at village naming ceremony. Life full circle, eh? From coup plots to cake and candles. Makes you think, maybe all these power games na just temporary, and in the end, we all go answer to the one upstairs who no dey take bribe.

But here's the kicker – while all these big talks dey fly, the ordinary man still dey hustle. From market to bus stop, we dey navigate the chaos with wit and faith. Politicians may flip like catfish in hot oil, threats may come from abroad, but Nigerians? We go survive, laugh, and pray our way through. Because if God no leave us for wilderness, who be dem to scatter our jollof? No, wait, scratch that – our pounded yam go remain solid, no matter the storm. And that na the real power move.
