Ah, my people, make una hear this one wey dey scatter my head like okra soup wey dem pour extra pepper. You sabi that American oga wey dey talk say e go send soldiers come scatter our peace here? Ehn, e be like say dem dey watch too much Nollywood film for Washington, thinking say we still dey inside colonial times. Imagine, e threaten to invade because of some wahala wey dem claim dey happen for our side, and our own people up there just summon all those embassy big boys to Abuja, dey yarn diplomacy like say na jollof rice competition. Shey you understand? Dem dey beg say make una no vex, we go fix am, but deep down, e be like God dey laugh for heaven, saying hold on, my children, e no reach that level yet. Grace still dey cover us, abi?

Now, shift gear small, talk about this Bayelsa matter wey dey make me chuckle. That governor wey been dey PDP camp, suddenly e jump fence go APC side, like say e see better pasture or maybe dem promise am free fuel for him generator. E be like party switching na our national sport now, more than wrestling for village square. One day you dey red, next you dey green, and followers just dey follow like goats wey see fresh grass. But e sweet me sha, because e show say even big men fit change jersey when wind blow. Reminds me of that Bible story where Paul switch from persecutor to preacher, total U-turn with Holy Spirit push. Na so life be, sometimes you gats pivot before you sink, but please, make una no use am as excuse to chop money wey no belong to una. Redemption dey, but accountability too!

Ehen, that one done, let me yarn una about this climate change talk wey Sanwo-Olu dey push for international ears. Him dey appeal to investors say come put money for Lagos green projects, like say na Christmas gift dem go get. E talk about ending insecurity and boosting economy, but me I dey think, brother, before you invite foreigners to plant trees, fix that flood wey dey turn streets to river every rainy season. Investors go come, see potholes bigger than Olympic swimming pool, and dem go run back to their countries faster than Usain Bolt. But e inspiring sha, see how him dey try weave hope into the mess. E be like Proverbs wey talk say wise man plant for future, even when storm dey gather. So, if dem no come, at least we go know say effort count, and God's plan no dey fail, even if human one scatter.

Speaking from another angle, this NNPC and refinery deal wey dem dey extend, paying in our own currency for crude oil. Sounds smart on paper, like keeping wealth inside family, but wait, shey e no go lead to more queue for pump or price wey climb higher than Mount Everest? Dem dey negotiate like market women haggling over yam, but end result na we, the common folks, go feel the pinch for pocket. E be absurd, this economic dance wey leaders dey do, promising stability while everything shake like sachet water for danfo boot. Yet, in the midst of am, I remember that verse about not worrying for tomorrow, because today's own don plenty. Faith go carry us through these twists, turning potential disaster to testimony.

Now, let me paint picture of how this all mix with our daily grind. Picture you dey hustle for market, selling tomatoes under hot sun, and radio blare say Yankee dey threaten war. You go laugh or cry? Me, I go laugh, because if soldiers come, first thing dem go ask na where una generator fuel dey, and we go tell dem say e finish since last week. Or that governor wey defect, him people go celebrate with one small party, but next day, same poverty dey knock door. Unemployment still dey bite hard, like dog wey no chop for days, and leaders dey talk big projects wey no reach ground. But here's the wisdom: in Nigerian style, we turn sorrow to song, wahala to wisdom. We pray, we push, and somehow, grace multiply our little into much.

Expand on that unemployment front small. Background dey shout say USA and our side dey tackle am together, but shey e no be like two boxers entering ring without gloves? Dem promise training programs, loans for small business, but end up, na seminar wey full grammar we get, no cash follow. Young boys and girls dey roam street, dreaming of Japan trip like that oga wey depart for there, but reality na hustling for okada or selling recharge card under bridge. E painful, but funny too, because we Nigerians sabi improvise. One boy go turn phone repair to empire, another go code app from cyber cafe. E be like parable of talents, where faithful servant multiply what him get. So, even when system fail, individual grace shine through, turning jobless to boss.

And this Igbos in Lagos talk, where some say one Nigeria na illusion. Ehn, my Igbo brothers, una dey build economy single-handed, yet some projects dey skew like bad tailoring. Alleged lopsidedness, people dey murmur, asking if leadership na for one zone only. But me I see am as family quarrel, where siblings fight over inheritance but still chop same eba. Unity under God no dey mirage; e dey real, if we choose forgiveness over grudge. Humor in am na how we go continue yarning pidgin across tribes, turning tension to banter at beer parlour.

Finally, this drummer confession wey dey trend, talking about the beat of our existence. Him say Nigerian condition na rhythm of survival, mixing joy with jara. Politicians promise heaven on earth, but only divine one deliver true peace. So, as we laugh at these headlines, remember, comedy na medicine, and faith na anchor. If Trump send memo or governor switch again, we go stand firm, because in the end, the greatest punchline na resurrection power wey no threat fit touch.
