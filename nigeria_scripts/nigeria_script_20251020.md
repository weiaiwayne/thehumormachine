Ah, my brothers and sisters, e be like say this our country don turn one big Nollywood script, full of twists wey no person fit predict. Imagine, President Tinubu dey there, shaking hands with Governor Soludo like dem two na old schoolmates from some elite university for Yankee, but na so dem show face for Aso Rock. Soludo zoom down from Anambra, probably dodging potholes wey be like mini Grand Canyons on the way, just to chop small gist with the big man. And wetin dem talk? Nobody sabi, but e sure say na about how to make this place shine like Dubai, abi na how to share the national cake without crumbs falling for ground. Shey you understand? Dem dey plan, dem dey plot, but for us wey dey hustle daily, e just mean say another promise go land, like manna from heaven, but e go disappear faster than your data bundle.

Now, talk of this heaven of corruption wey dem dey call Naija, e no be new film o. E be like say every corner get one scriptwriter wey dey add more drama. Open letters flying left and right to Mr. President, like say e na your village uncle wey you dey beg for wedding money. One person go write, "Oga, abeg fix this economy before we all turn to ghosts." Another one go say, "Sir, why this wahala no dey end?" But Tinubu, him go read am, smile, and continue with him special moves. Dem say him be agent of CIA, you hear that one? Haba, if na true, then America don send superman to fix our mess, but e be like say him superpower na to make dollar stronger while our own currency dey do press-up. E funny how conspiracy theories dey fly faster than okada for Oshodi, everybody get one theory: na Illuminati, na aliens, na even old gods from Yoruba pantheon. But me, I think say if CIA wan send agent, dem go pick person wey fit blend in, no be this our fine president wey dey look like him get style magazine cover.

E get this by-election wey APC just win big, dem dey shout say na endorsement for Tinubu's regime. Massive win, dem call am, like say dem score hat-trick for World Cup final. But wait first, who even vote for by-election when everybody dey worry about plate of rice wey cost like private jet fuel? Dem go say, "See, people love our leader!" But truth be say, half the voters sef no sabi wetin dem dey vote for, dem just follow the bandwagon or collect small brown envelope. E be like church harvest, where pastor go announce big collection, but members go contribute with eye service, hoping say heaven go credit their account later. And speaking of heaven, even in this political circus, e sweet to remember say true redemption no come from ballot box alone, but from upstairs, where no by-election fit rig the results. Tinubu special, dem say, because him get achievements like former Lagos governor—roads, bridges, all that jazz. But shey those achievements reach everywhere? For some places, e still be like say progress dey holiday, waiting for visa.

Ah, now let me yarn una about this unemployment matter wey dey pain everybody like ulcer. Dem compare USA government with our own, like say na football match. Over there, dem get programs, training, jobs popping like popcorn. Here, e be like say government dey try, but e scatter like bad jollof rice. Young graduates dey queue for one position wey fit 500 people, sweating under sun wey dey hotter than pastor's sermon on tithe day. One boy go apply for bank job, next thing, him turn Uber driver, dodging crazy motorists wey drive like say dem dey race for Formula One. And the wahala? Politicians go promise youth empowerment, send una to farm or learn tailor, but when rain fall, farm flood, and sewing machine need light wey no dey consistent. E funny how dem dey talk big about tackling it, but e be like say the solution dey hide under politician's cap, waiting for magic wand. But you know, in the midst of this struggle, e comforting to think say God's plan no dey cancel like flight delay—Him get job for everybody, even if na to pray for better leaders first.

That one time I dey think about how this our system work, e be like puzzle wey missing half the pieces. Tinubu dey receive visitors like celebrity, Soludo one day, maybe tomorrow na foreign investor or even that open letter writer wey go turn advisor. Dem go sit, drink tea or something stronger, discuss how to make Naija great again. But for market woman wey dey sell pepper, e no change anything—price still climb like climber monkey. She go shout, "Madam, why this tin cost pass my rent?" And the buyer go hiss, continue bargaining like say na wrestling match. E absurd how politics touch every corner, from state house to street corner. And the CIA agent talk? If Tinubu na spy, then him mission na to teach us endurance, because American spies for film go fix problem in two hours, but ours dey take decades. Laughter go come when we realize say the real agent na us, the people, wey go keep pushing till breakthrough.

Now, imagine if dem turn this political gist into reality show, "Big Brother Aso Rock." Tinubu na host, Soludo na contestant, task na to solve one national issue per week. Week one: fix power, but oops, blackout again. Week two: unemployment, send 100 youths to USA for training, but visa deny all. Audience go vote, but na SMS wey cost 100 naira each, so only rich people decide. And the prize? One year of steady light and affordable food. But in truth, e no be game—e real life wey we all dey act part. Yet, e dey inspire say even in script wey full of plot holes, grace dey patch am up, like divine editor wey no dey charge fee. Dem say Tinubu special because him get vision, but the ultimate vision na from the Good Book, where leaders rise and fall, but faithfulness endures.

E sweet to see how dem celebrate that by-election like festival, APC dancing azonto in victory. But deep down, e question be: na real endorsement or just temporary high like cheap ogogoro? People dey hope say e mean better days ahead, jobs multiplying like loaves and fishes. But if no fish come, at least the story remind us say miracles happen when least expected. Soludo visit fit be small thing, but e symbolize unity, like family reunion where uncles argue over inheritance but still chop jollof together. In this our Naija, unity na the real superpower, stronger than any CIA gadget. And when wahala pile up, we turn to faith, whispering prayers that echo louder than any campaign noise.

Finally, brothers and sisters, if this political heaven full of clouds no rain blessing soon, remember say the true heaven no need visa or endorsement—e open to all wey believe, no by-election required. So, let's keep laughing through the storm, because joy na the best weapon against any scriptwriter's plot twist.
