Oya, good evening everybody! Welcome, welcome! You know how we do it. Another Friday, another dose of wahala turned laughter. My name is Chijioke Eze, your comedian for the night, and I'm here to tell you... Nigeria, ehn? She dey try my patience, I swear.

So, Tinubu, baba dey try, I go give am that. "Renewed Hope," he promised. And truly, my hope is renewed...every time I remember I have enough data to rant on Twitter! But seriously, the man is pushing these tax reforms like he's trying to break Usain Bolt's record. Every day, new tax! I heard them discussing it on Nairaland, one guy said, "Soon, dem go tax us for breathing!" Which, considering the Lagos air quality, might actually be fair.

And this "All Democratic Alliance" sef, trying to become the new big boys. I see una! You think we don forget how quickly these alliances scatter? Last time, coalition was like gala and mineral - sweet for a minute, upset stomach the next. Remember that senator who jumped parties three times in one year? I think say he dey do frog jump for gym!

Speaking of gym, I see say some Nigerians dey embrace remote work now. Making dollars, chilling in their boxers, answering Zoom calls. See, that's the kind of progress I can get behind! No more fighting for bus, no more agbero harassing you for 'owo mi'. Imagine, you are earning dollars from America, while the neighbor is fighting with NEPA for light. Is that not the definition of enjoyment?

But make I tell una something wey pain me. I saw one thread on Reddit, some oyinbo praising Nigerian prison officers for their hard work in Texas! Texas! So, our people go work hard for oyinbo prison, but for Kirikiri… wait, wait, I no wan enter trouble. Let me just say, our institutions deserve the best of us too.

And speaking of Reddit, all those rants about Nigerian churches? Hmmm. I grew up going to church. Every Sunday, mummy will drag me, even if I pretend to have fever. But these days, the pastors and their "holy" anointing oil that cures everything from malaria to heartbreak? It's like they've taken a page from the Yahoo boys' playbook. “Send your seed of faith, and receive double blessings!” Double blessings of what, inflated tithes?

Wait, what? Did I just see a tweet that they are proposing a new tax on anointing oil? I should copyright that!

But at the end of the day, we are Nigerians. We survive, we hustle, we laugh. We complain about NEPA, about fuel price, about the politicians. We complain about everything! But we still find a way to throw the best owambes, eat the spiciest jollof, and make the world know we're here. Remember those remote workers, making dollars? That's the spirit! That is that "Renewed Hope" we really need. Not government promises, but the hope we create for ourselves. The kind of hope that says, "Even if NEPA cut light, I go still find cold beer to drink!"

Oya, who dey buy me beer? Because all this talk about taxes, I need something to ease my pain! And maybe, just maybe, by next week, I'll have even more to rant about. Because in Nigeria, there's always gbas gbos happening somewhere! Cheers, everyone!
