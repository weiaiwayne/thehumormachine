Good evening, my people, make we gather here this night to yarn about these matters wey dey turn our heads upside down, especially with how our leaders dey play chess with the whole world. You see this thing with that big voice from across the ocean, Donald Trump, threatening to send soldiers our way? Ehen, him talk say him go do military action if things no change quick quick. Now, our side summon every foreign envoy for meeting in the capital, telling dem say we dey handle am diplomatically. But chai, imagine the wahala—wait, no be wahala, the confusion—for those diplomats, dem come from everywhere, sitting down, sipping tea, while our officials explain say we go sort it out without noise. Me, I dey think, if Trump really send troops, dem go land for airport, see queue for immigration longer than harmattan cough, and turn back sharp sharp. Abi, who wan fight for place wey passport control alone fit dem finish?

Now, speaking on switching sides, this Bayelsa chief executive don leave PDP, cross over to APC like say e dey change shirt for match. One day him dey red camp, next morning him wear blue, hailing the top man for staying neutral in that Anambra vote. Neutral, eh? As if say election no be war zone with parties throwing jabs left and right. This kind move, e dey remind me of those market women wey dey sell tomato, one minute dem loyal to one supplier, next dem jump to another wey promise better price. But for politics, e no be small thing—e dey scatter alliances, make opposition dey sweat. And the cheers from his new team? Dem dey celebrate like say dem win lottery. But truth be say, in our system, loyalty be like okada rider: quick to change lane when traffic tight.

That brings me to honoring elders, like how the big oga congratulate that former military head, Babangida, as e clock 84 years. Ehen, 84, my brother, that man see plenty—coups, transitions, everything. Message come, full of respect, wishing am more years of wisdom. Wisdom, yes, because in our history books, him page full with stories wey still dey teach lessons. But imagine if Babangida reply back: "Thank you, but at my age, the only coup I dey plan na against this high blood pressure." Or him go say, "I don tire for drama, now I just wan enjoy my grandchildren and maybe advise these young ones to stop jumping parties like frog for rain." E dey sweet to see such gestures, remind us say even in the rough game, respect for seniors no dey lost. And for us ordinary folks, e dey inspire: if military general fit reach 84 with stories, then our own hustle fit carry we far, by God's grace alone.

Shifting gears to health workers, these resident doctors don strike again, and the administration dey move to end am fast. Doctors, una deserve better, no doubt—una dey save lives daily, yet salary dey lag like old radio signal. Government promise talks, negotiations, to bring dem back table. But you know how e be: strike start, hospitals empty, patients dey pray for miracle. Me, I dey wonder, if doctors strike, who go treat the politicians when dem catch cold from too much AC in those big houses? Perhaps dem go call pastor or imam to pray the fever away. And the grace in that? Even when human hands no dey available, divine healing still possible, as Bible talk say by His stripes we dey healed. So, doctors, hold on, but make we pray say peace come quick, so una no go turn to emergency for real.

Now, on economy side, this deal between the national oil company and that massive refinery—dem dey talk to extend supply using our currency, no more dollar wahala. Ehen, if e work, e fit ease the pressure on exchange rates, make fuel flow smoother, and maybe reduce those long lines at stations. But you sabi how these things go: announcement come, hope rise, then delay, then small drama. Imagine the refinery owner, big businessman, shaking hands with oil bosses, promising steady crude in naira. For we street people, e mean perhaps cheaper transport, less generator noise at night. Because, wait, no be because, actually, when power fail, as e dey do often, we run to genset, but if fuel cheapen, e go sweet pass. And in that darkness, when NEPA take light, we remember say God's light no dey flicker—e steady, guiding us through the blackout, like that verse in Psalms about lamp to our feet.

Speaking of city bosses, this Lagos State head, Sanwo-Olu, dey appeal to global investors on climate change at some international forum. Him talk about green projects, sustainable growth, inviting money to build better. E sound good on paper—less pollution, more trees, fight against flooding wey dey turn streets to river every rain. But for us wey dey hustle daily, dodging potholes and danfo madness, e dey like promise of paradise, but road still rough. Imagine investor from abroad come, see the appeal, then step out to traffic jam wey last three hours. Him go think twice. Yet, Sanwo-Olu try, pushing for change. And the faith angle? Even as we face environmental heat, the Bible remind us say earth is the Lord's, so with wise stewardship, we fit cool things down, trusting in redemption for our land.

Another hot one: this talk about lopsided projects, some say the top man favoring his home base over the rest. Ehen, whispers everywhere, asking if e dey run the whole country or just one spot. Then Igbos in the commercial hub claiming unity be illusion. Chai, these divisions, dem dey pull us apart like rope in tug-of-war. But as comedian, I see the absurdity: politicians build bridges in one area, while elsewhere roads still red earth. Perhaps dem need to draw from Solomon's wisdom—divide the baby fair, or in this case, the budget even. And for coexistence, Sanwo-Olu himself yarn about our challenged living together, calling for harmony. True talk, because without it, we go scatter like market after rain. But hope dey: in Christ, we one body, no division, so if leaders learn that, e go better.

On unemployment, what the American side and our own dey do to tackle am? Talks, policies, but results slow like snail in sun. Youths graduate, CV fly everywhere, yet jobs scarce as gold. Me, I dey advise: turn that hustle to business, start small, trust God for increase, like parable of talents. No dey wait for white collar; grab wrapper, sell provision. And for those foreign threats, Trump talk tough, but our diplomatic moves show we no dey fear—engaging smart, praying hard.

Finally, this neutrality in Anambra election, APC praising the top for no side-eye. Ehen, as if say staying out no be strategy. But in end, e dey show say game dey evolve, parties merging, defecting, all for power. Yet, through the mess, we laugh, we pray, knowing grace cover us. So, my people, as 2026 start fresh, make we hold faith tight—even when threats loom or parties switch, God's plan no dey shake. And if Trump call again, tell am say we get our own army: prayers and pidgin power. Thank you!
