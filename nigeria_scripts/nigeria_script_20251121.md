Eh, my people, picture this: one fine morning, the oga for Bayelsa decide say e don tire of dat old party wey e dey, so e jump fence go join di new one like say na jollof rice contest. You sabi how we dey do am here? Politicians dey switch sides faster than Okada rider wey see police checkpoint. One day na blue, next day na green, and we di masses just dey watch, shaking head, wondering if dem get membership card or na just fashion show. Abi, you no see am? Dis oga from Bayelsa, e announce say e dey cross over, and suddenly everybody dey hail am like e discover cure for headache. But me, I dey ask: wetin next? Tomorrow e go jump again? Na so we dey live, where loyalty na like recharge card—e finish, you buy new one.

Now, let me yarn una small small on dis matter of our doctors wey dey fold arm, no dey work. You know dat feeling when you get belle ache or headache wey wan scatter your skull, and you rush go hospital, only to find say di place empty like church on Monday morning? Dem doctors dey on strike again, fighting for better pay, and who go blame dem? Di work dem dey do, e no be joke—dem dey patch people from accident, deliver pikin, fix broken bone—yet dem salary dey like pocket money for secondary school boy. Government promise to end di strike, but e be like promise of politician during rainy season: plenty thunder, no rain. Me, I imagine say if doctors continue like dis, we go start use agbo for operation, or pray say malaria take holiday. But seriously, my sister fall ill last week, we carry am go clinic, di nurse just give paracetamol and Bible verse. Shey you understand? In dis our land, health care na mix of medicine and miracle, because without one, di oda no fit work alone.

Speaking of miracles, let us touch on dis unemployment wahala wey dey chase everybody like dog wey see fresh meat. Over dia in America, dem dey roll out plans, training programs, big money to create jobs, but here, e be like dem dey compare football match to wrestling ring. Our own side, dem dey talk say dem wan tackle am, but di young people dey graduate from university, hold certificate wey shine like new naira note, only to sit down for house, waiting for call wey no dey come. I see my cousin, fine boy, read engineering, now e dey hawk recharge card for junction. Every day, e wake up, dress fine fine, send CV like say na love letter, but reply na "position filled" or silence wey louder than siren. And di big men wey suppose fix am, dem dey travel up and down—Japan one day, Brazil di next—coming back with handshake photo, but no job for we. Na so e be? We pray for breakthrough, because as di Bible talk, di laborer deserve him wage, but here, di laborer dey beg for small change. Grace go locate us sha, e no go tire.

Ah, and dis talk of unity wey everybody dey shout, especially when it come to our brothers from di East living for di West—e be like mirage for desert, you see am from far, but when you reach, na sand. Dem say one country, but look at di projects: roads wey shine for one side, bridges wey dem build quick quick, while oda places dey beg for borehole. Is di top man ruling for whole or just him backyard? Igbos for di West, dem hustle, build business, pay tax, yet sometimes e feel like dem dey carry load wey no be dem own. You know how e dey? One time, my uncle from Enugu open shop for di city, customers plenty, but wahala follow—harassment, envy, like say success na crime. We suppose be family, abi? Share di load, share di gain, but e be like some people dey play favoritism like mama wey like one pikin pass oda. Di Bible teach say love your neighbor as yourself, no partiality, but here, neighbor sometimes mean "if e no be like me, shift." Na why we need dat redemption spirit, to turn mirage to river, make everybody drink.

Wait, let me no forget dis one wey dey make me laugh inside: di oil big men unveiling plan to change di whole industry, like say dem wan turn black gold to white miracle. Dem talk of transformation, new deals, even extending supply wey use local money instead of dollar wahala. Sound good, ehn? But me, I remember last year, same talk, same promise, and now we still dey queue for small small. Dem say na to make am better, reduce import, but I dey fear say e go end like di rest—plenty meeting, photo op, then back to old style. Imagine if dem succeed: price go drop, light go stay, economy go dance azonto. But for now, we dey manage, using faith as generator. Because even when plan fail, God's plan no dey shake.

And on dat note of faith, let us yarn about dis summon of foreign big shots to Abuja over threat from dat American oga wey talk military action. Dem gather diplomats, talk diplomacy, assure say no shaking. E be like family meeting where uncle from abroad wan scatter table, but papa dey calm everybody. Trump talk say e fit send troops, maybe over some issue wey dem blow small, but our side reply say we dey handle am our way. Me, I dey think: wetin concern America with we internal matter? Dem get dem own problem—guns everywhere, election drama—yet dem wan police di world. We no need soldier; we need peace wey come from dialogue, not gun. And as Christians, we know say sword no solve, but prayer and wisdom do. Tinubu hail for staying neutral in some state matter, but neutrality na like walking on wire—no fall left, no fall right.

Now, di most dangerous place award go to... wait for it... di city of hustle wey everybody know, but dem say e top chart for risk. Traffic no be joke, pickpocket like shadow, yet people dey thrive. Why? Because resilience na our middle name. You dodge pothole, pay bribe to move, but at end of day, you reach home, thank God. Dat na di Nigerian spirit—turn danger to story, wahala to wisdom.

Finally, my people, in all dis political dance, party switch, strike, job hunt, unity talk, oil plan, threat from abroad—e be like orchestra wey conductor dey try control, but players dey play own tune. But hold on, because as e dey for scripture, what man mean for bad, God turn to good. So we go laugh, we go pray, we go push, until di rhythm change for better. And if politician no deliver, at least Jesus no dey disappoint—him promise eternal, and e dey keep am. Peace out, stay blessed.
