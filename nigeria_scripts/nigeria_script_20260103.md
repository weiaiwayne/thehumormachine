Eh, make una hear this one wey dey happen for our side, e be like say the world don turn upside down with all these big men throwing words like confetti at wedding. You sabi that American oga, the one wey dey always tweet fire, now him don open mouth talk say him go send soldiers come chop body if things no straight here. Na wa o, as if we no get enough wahala with our own matters. Imagine, one minute dem dey watch football for White House, next thing, dem dey plan invasion for Naija. Me sef, I dey think, wetin we do this man? Abi na because of that our jollof wey dey make international headlines, him wan come taste am by force? No be so, sha. But seriously, our leaders dem summon all those embassy people for meeting, like say na town hall for village square. Dem sit down, drink tea, yarn about peace, while the rest of us dey wonder if generator go carry for night. E be like God dey laugh from heaven, saying, see my children, even kings fit shake when wind blow.

Now, speaking to that, you see this Bayelsa oga, the governor wey been dey rock PDP colors like him born with am, suddenly him wake up one morning, dust him agbada, and jump fence go APC side. Haba, na which kind loyalty be that? Yesterday, him dey hail opposition like family, today him dey clap for ruling party as if na new love. Nigerians wey dey follow politics like soap opera, una see how e dey play out? One day, na red dem wear, next day, na broom dem carry parade. Me, I dey ask, this man, wetin him chop wey make am switch so fast? Abi na that popular rice and stew wey APC dey share for rallies? Or perhaps, na dream where angel appear say, go join dem, redemption dey wait. E sweet pass Bible story, where Paul change from persecutor to preacher. But here, no be Damascus road, na just power corridor for Bayelsa. And the people, dem dey shake head, saying, if governor fit flip like plantain for hot oil, how we go trust anybody again? Yet, in all this, e dey remind me say, true change no come from party color, but from heart wey God touch.

That one take me to another level, this matter with our former head of state, the one dem call IBB, now clocking 84 years. Our current number one citizen send greeting, congratulate am like old classmate for reunion. E good sha, to see respect cross generations, even with all the history wey full of drama. You remember how that era been, with coups and calendars changing like weather? Now, at 84, him dey rest, while we dey hustle under new sun. But e be like a lesson from proverbs, say wisdom come with age, and forgiveness na key wey unlock doors. Imagine if politicians learn that, instead of always plotting next move like chess masters. Me sef, at my age, I no reach half, but I dey pray make God grant me grace to age well, without switching sides every season. And for the man wey dey congratulate, e show say even in high office, small humility fit shine. Nigerians, una feel am? In a land where grudge hold longer than queue for bank, this na breath of fresh air, abi?

Oya, let me yarn una about this other gist, the one where our state oga for that commercial hub appeal to foreign investors on climate matter. Him stand there, talk smooth, say come put money for green projects, as if na easy like buying akara from roadside. But wait, while him dey invite world to save planet, back home, we still dey battle with flood wey swallow roads every rainy season. E be irony wey fit make comedian rich. You go there, see billboards shouting sustainability, but step out, and danfo dey pack like sardine in traffic wey no end. And the investors, dem go come with their briefcases, promise heaven, but deliver only memo. Na so life be for us, always chasing tomorrow while today dey bite. Yet, e sweet how leaders try paint picture of progress, even if canvas full of holes. Reminds me of that scripture where David face Goliath with faith, no weapon. Here, na mouth and plan dem use face global wahala. But for we ordinary people, we dey pray make rain no wash away our small hustle, and may God's umbrella cover us all.

Now, shift gear small to this deal between that oil giant and the big refinery owner. Dem dey talk extend supply with local currency, no more dollar wahala. Sounds promising, like breakthrough after long night. But Nigerians, una know how these things go? One day, na announcement for headline, next week, na explanation why e no work. Remember how we always hear of big plans to fix economy, but pocket still dey cry? E be like fisherman wey promise full net, but come back with empty basket, blaming sea. And the youth, dem dey jobless, wandering market like lost sheep, while big boys sign papers in air-conditioned rooms. Me, I dey think, if this deal sweet pass, make e reach ground, so that graduate no go turn okada rider by default. In faith, we hold on, believing that provision come from above, not just from boardroom. Even when deals delay, God's timing no dey late.

Eh, and no forget that strike by doctors wey dey resident, now government dey move to end am. Good news, finally, because hospital no be place for empty bed. You sabi how e be, when sickness catch you, and no medic around, na prayer chamber turn operating theater. Families dey run up and down, begging for attention, while leaders yarn elsewhere. But now, dem sit down, negotiate like market women over price. Hope say e end well, so that healing no go depend on luck. E touch heart, see how one small action fit save lives, reminding us of compassion wey Jesus teach. In Naija, where stress plenty, make health system strong, abi? So that when fever come, no be only paracetamol from church we go rely on.

All these matters dey connect like beads on rosary, showing how one thread pull the whole. From foreign threats to local switches, celebrations to appeals, deals to doctor peace. We dey navigate am with humor, because if we no laugh, tears go flood. But deep down, faith dey anchor, saying hold on, better day dey come. Even in chaos, grace shine through, like sun after harmattan. So, my people, make we keep eyes up, pray hard, and yarn plenty, because in the end, na laughter wey conquer fear. And if Trump or anybody wan try nonsense, make dem know, Naija spirit no bend, e bounce back stronger, by God's power.
