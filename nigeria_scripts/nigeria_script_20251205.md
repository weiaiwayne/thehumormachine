Wahala for head o, as our big oga up there don turn international referee, summoning every diplomat inside Abuja over that wild talk from Trump wey threaten say him go send soldiers come scatter our peace. Imagine, one minute we dey manage our small-small wahala, next thing, American president dey yarn like say Nigeria na him backyard wey need sweeping. E be like say dem forget say we don survive worse threats, from colonial masters to civil war drums, and still we dey stand tall. Shey you sabi that feeling when you dey queue for ATM, hoping say naira go cash out, then boom, international drama enter? Na so e be, but our leaders quick-quick call meeting, assure everybody say dem dey handle am with sweet talks and handshakes. Me, I dey laugh, because if Trump fit understand Pidgin, him for know say "no gree for anybody" na our national anthem for such times.

Now, speaking of switching sides faster than chameleon for dry season, that Bayelsa governor don jump ship from PDP to APC, like say na new jollof recipe wey dem discover overnight. E no be first time, but this one sweet pass, especially when elections dey loom. You know how e dey be for Naija politics, person go dey one camp today, tomorrow e don cross over with full band and drummers. Maybe na the grass greener on the other side, or perhaps na promise of better rice and stew wey pull am. But think am, if politicians fit switch parties like wey change shirt after heavy rain, why una no fit switch jobs when economy tight? E go make sense na, especially for those graduates wey dey roam street with CV for hand, waiting for miracle. Abi, if governor fit dump old party, make graduates dump old CV and start fresh hustle.

That one wey follow na how Lagos APC dey praise Tinubu for staying neutral for Anambra matter, like say him dey play Switzerland for African edition. Neutrality, eh? E sound good on paper, but for ground zero, e be like referee wey blow whistle and hide for corner when fight start. Anambra people dey watch, waiting to see if neutrality go bring fair play or just more promises wey evaporate like morning dew under sun. Me, I dey wonder, if neutrality na the game, why politicians no use am for potholes too? Neutral pothole wey no swallow danfo, neutral traffic wey no jam from morning till night. Shey e no go better? And while dem dey hail neutrality, ordinary man dey neutral between salary and market price, trying to balance book without calculator.

Ehn, but let's yarn true true on that U-turn wey government do for that 15 percent tariff on fuel import. One day dem announce am with full chest, next e don reverse like keke wey miss road. Policy flip-flop, na wetin dem call am for book, but for street, na "change of mind after belle full." You sabi that uncle wey promise to pay school fees, then suddenly remember say "economy hard," same thing. Dem say na to ease pressure on masses, but e too late, because prices don already climb hill like goat for dry harmattan. Now, with doctors strike wey dem dey try end, e be like say government dey run marathon, but always stop to tie shoe lace midway. Doctors wan better pay, patients wan quick healing, but wahala persist because negotiation dey drag like okada for bad road. Imagine if hospital na like bank, where queue short and service fast, but no, na Naija style, wait and pray.

Speaking of prayer, e remind me how we Nigerians always find way to mix faith with frenzy. Even when tariff flip and doctors argue, we go church, sing "through it all, God's grace sufficient." Na true talk, because politicians fit promise paradise on earth, but only divine intervention go fix that lingering ache for pocket. You know, like that time when NEPA take light for middle of power outage prayer meeting, and pastor say "even in darkness, light of world shine." E go make you smile, abi? Because for this our condition, where coexistence challenge everybody from market woman to state head, we need that hope wey no fade. Not the type wey politician yarn during campaign, but real one wey come from above, turning water to wine, or better, turning scarcity to abundance.

Now, on that NNPC and refinery deal wey dem dey extend for crude supply with naira, e be like family reunion where money no travel abroad again. Good tin, because dollar dey act like scarce jollof for party. But question na, if dem fit keep am local, why una no extend same to other sectors? Make farmer get naira loan without stress, make trader no worry about exchange rate wahala. E go reduce that daily battle wey we fight, from dawn market run to night generator noise. And while dem talk diplomacy with Trump threat, assuring say no military come, e sweet my belle, because we no need foreign boot on ground when we get enough internal drama to fill soap opera.

Ehn, that matter of Tinubu congratulating Babangida for him 84th, e show say even old soldiers no fade away, dem just collect cake and continue. IBB, the gap-tooth general, now dey bask in well-wishes, and e make sense, because experience no dey expire like yogurt for fridge. But imagine if we apply that wisdom to current wahala, like ending doctors strike with military precision or handling tariff with veteran strategy. No be so? Instead, we dey manage, patch here, flip there, while people dey hope for redemption that come not from ballot but from higher power.

You see, for this our challenged coexistence, from state house to street corner, humor na the oil wey smooth the rough edges. Like when traffic jam hold you, and you remember say "even Paul and Silas sing for prison, so make I yarn joke." Na so we survive, laughing at absurdity, like governor switching party or diplomats scrambling. But deep down, we know say grace dey cover am, turning threat to testimony, flip to favor. And if Trump still dey yarn military, make him know say Naija spirit na unbreakable, forged in fire and prayer. Shey you feel me?

Wetin next na that extraordinary teen wey dey make waves, but that's story for another day. For now, let's cherish the small wins, like neutral play wey no lead to fight, or deal wey keep dollar away. Because in end, no be politician promise go save us, na that unchanging hope wey say "fear not, for I am with you." And with that, wahala don reduce small.
