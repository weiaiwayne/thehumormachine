Ah, my people! Chijioke Eze live and direct! How una dey? Abeg, pour me one Star, make we reason this Naija matter. Because, ha! Where do we even start?

I been dey read Reddit, I been dey see Nairaland, and honestly, I feel like I need to book appointment with Dr. Phil. This country dey give me agida.

First of all, dem dey argue about AI. AI! As in, artificial intelligence! My people, we still dey struggle with NEPA intelligence, now dem bring artificial one. Wetin we go do with AI when we still dey use candle at night? Na AI go pay my PHCN bill? I dey ask oh!

And then, I see that photo of the hostel in Ghana. Ah, Ghana! Look, I love Ghana jollof as much as the next man, but when dem start to shame us with student hostels? That one pain me to my bone marrow. See, I remember my own hostel days at UNN. Those were the days! Four people to a room meant for two, bedbugs doing the tango on your mattress at night… Ah, good times! Good times. But seriously, wetin dey happen? Even Ghana dey show us pepper now?

And speaking of pepper, this government! Tinubu, Baba himself, still dey promise us he go solve the economy and security wahala. Ah, Baba, we don hear that one before. Every single time! Na so so promise! But me, I wan see action. I wan see dollar come down from Mount Everest. I wan see bandits become born-again Christians. Is that too much to ask?

Then I see for news say Nigeria no wan accept deportees from America. Tori Olorun! As if we no get enough problems already. We don’t even have enough space for the ones that haven’t left! We’re already exporting talents, now we should be importing deported uncles?

And Peter Obi, ehn? Them dey call am desperate. Desperate for wetin? To win election? Which politician no desperate? Maybe na because e no dey share money openly? Maybe na because e dey speak grammar wey some people no understand? Abeg, let the man breathe!

And that cookbook! N40,000 for cookbook? Ah! My grandma go dey turn for grave. My grandma who can cook anything with just salt, pepper and Maggi. N40,000! For that kind money, I fit buy goat, slaughter am, cook am pepper soup, invite all of una here to come chop! But maybe that’s why I’m not a millionaire.

Wait, what? Did I just say I'd invite all of you? NEPA fit take light before the goat finish cooking oh! See, even my own jokes get Nigerian problems.

But seriously, my people, at the end of the day, we must laugh oh. If we no laugh, we go cry. And crying no go solve anything. So, let's raise our Star, make we toast to Nigeria. To a country where anything can happen, and usually does. To a country where we go dey complain, but we no go ever leave. Because, as dem dey say, "There is no place like home, even if the light no dey." Cheers!
