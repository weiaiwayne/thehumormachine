Oya, good evening everybody! You all look good, sharp! Ehen, I see that my people have come out tonight despite the NEPA wahala. You know, it's gotten so bad, I saw a cockroach carrying a candle the other day. Even the insects are tired of this darkness!

So, who saw that thing on Reddit about AI? They're asking how to handle AI generated content. My people, we can't even handle NEPA generated power, how are we going to handle AI? Abeg, let's focus on problems we can actually solve, like, maybe getting fuel that's not liquid gold?

But speaking of problems we can't solve, I saw somebody posted that "Nigeria is a cemetery for the living". Ah, my brother, you are speaking my mind! I mean, the way things are going, even the dead are looking for visa to Japa. They're saying "Even afterlife better for Yankee, at least constant light dey!"

And speaking of japa, that Black American on Reddit asking if he looks Nigerian? Bros, if you can survive the hustle in Lagos, you are automatically Nigerian. It's not about the look, it's about the resilience! Come, let me put you in Ikeja traffic for one hour, you go understand immediately.

But seriously, since Tinubu took over, things have been...interesting. That subsidy removal? Omo, my wallet is crying everyday. It's like going to market and the yam seller looks at you and says, "This yam has PhD, you must pay extra!" And that exchange rate unification? My dollars are smiling, but my account balance is frowning. It's a bittersweet symphony, I tell you.

You know, I was at a wedding last week, and the groom's father was giving a speech. He said, "My son, marriage is like Nigerian politics...full of promises you can't keep!" The whole hall erupted in laughter. Then the bride's father got up and said, "Yes, and like Nigerian politics, you'll spend all your money trying to fix it!" Wait, what? The wedding planner nearly fainted.

Remember that story about those guys trying to sneak into Dubai dressed as Arab women? Only in Nigeria! Ah, we have mastered the art of packaging. I bet they even had fake eyelashes and everything. But you know what? I almost admire their hustle. They saw an opportunity, and they took it...with a hijab.

But honestly, it's not all bad. We still have our humor, our resilience, and our jollof rice. Even if the price of pepper has doubled, we still find a way to make that jollof slap! And that Reddit post about Nigeria being a cemetery for the living? We'll just turn it into a party! We'll have Owambe in the graveyard, constant music, plenty food, and generator running 24/7. After all, where else are we going to go? At least for now, we are here, and we will laugh.
