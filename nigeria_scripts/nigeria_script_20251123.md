Wetin dey happen with these oga at the top switching sides faster than a market woman bargaining for tomatoes? You see that one from Bayelsa, the big chief there, e just wake up one day and decide say PDP no longer sweet am, so e jump fence go APC camp. Chai, na so life be? One minute you dey chop jollof with one party, next minute you dey sip tea with the other. Me I no blame am sha, because if e stay put, maybe dem go forget am like old wrapper. But imagine if we ordinary people fit do the same, eh? If your boss no dey pay salary on time, you just dump job go next office, abi? No wahala, no notice period. Politicians teach us say loyalty na for suckers, and e sweet me die.

That move remind me of how things dey twist here, especially when foreign powers start poking nose. You hear wetin that American oga, Trump, talk? E threaten say e go send soldiers come scatter everything if we no behave. As if our own internal drama no enough, now we get Hollywood-style invasion plot. Our side summon all those diplomats for meeting in the capital, like say na family meeting to beg uncle from abroad make e no vex. And the response? Dem say we dey handle am with sweet talk and handshakes. Me I laugh, because which country never get wahala? But e be like say dem fear say if soldiers land, dem go turn our potholes into parade grounds. Truth be told, if Trump send army, first thing dem go do na join queue for bread, because hunger no respect uniform.

Speaking of twists, check this U-turn on that 15 percent charge for bringing in fuel. One day dem announce am like na law from heaven, next day dem reverse like keke wey miss junction. Why? Because the queues already long pass snake in harmattan, and people dey vex. E be like policy makers dey play chess with our pockets, but forget say we no be pawns wey go stay quiet. I remember last time something like this happen, my neighbor sell him generator just to buy extra jerrycan. Now dem backtrack, and we suppose clap? At least e show say voice of the masses fit echo, even if na small small. But e sweet pass when dem promise to stop that doctors strike. Imagine, white coat warriors folding arms while hospitals empty like church on Monday. Dem say dem go negotiate, step by step, like careful dance on hot coals. If dem no end am quick, next time you fall sick, e go be prayer warrior time, because medicine man dey home dey fast.

Now, let us yarn about neutrality in that Anambra matter. The APC people hail their main man for staying out of the mix, like referee wey no blow whistle too early. Neutrality, eh? In our clime, that word na like unicorn—everybody talk am, but nobody see am in action. E be as if saying, "I no dey pick side, but my side na the winning one." Me I respect am, because if e jump in, the whole thing for turn to wrestling match with gavel. And while at it, dem still find time to celebrate old soldier-turned-leader, Babangida, as e clock 84. Congrats o, General! At that age, surviving our heat and hustle na medal in itself. E make me think, if our elders fit endure, why we young ones dey complain for small rain? But seriously, birthday wishes from top show say history no forget, even if memory selective.

These events dey pile up like unswept market dirt, and e force me to wonder if coordination na lost art. One hand dey fight external threats with diplomacy, other dey patch internal leaks with quick fixes. E be like conductor wey dey drive bus with one eye on road, other on rearview mirror chasing ghosts. And we passengers? We just hold tight, pray make tire no burst. But here is the beauty—through all this chaos, there na thread of hope wey no break. You know, like that Bible story where David face giant with just sling and faith. Politicians go promise mountains, but real strength come from above, the one wey no change with election cycles. Even when plans flip like akara in hot oil, grace steady like rock. So, as dem switch parties and dodge threats, make we remember say ultimate boss no dey campaign; He dey reign forever.

That Bayelsa switch again, e open door for more stories. Suppose every politician fit jump like that, what stop opposition from forming own party every week? Na go be like Nollywood series, episode one: betrayal, episode two: comeback. And the followers? Dem go follow like sheep to new pasture, hoping grass greener. But in truth, grass na grass, just different shade of brown from drought. Me I no fit judge too much, because if my village chief offer better kola nut, I go switch allegiance sharp sharp. E na human nature, survival mode on full blast. Yet, e funny how power chase turn grown men to kids fighting over toy. Dem forget say people wey dem lead dey watch, learn say loyalty optional.

On the Trump angle, imagine the scene in that diplomat meeting. Suits from everywhere, sipping water, assuring say no be war film. Our representatives dey counter with facts, like "Oga, we get our own soldiers, dem fit handle." But deep down, e be fear mixed with pride. Nobody wan see boots marching through hometown, turning festivals to checkpoints. And the assurance wey follow? Diplomatic engagement, meaning plenty phone calls and emails till headache. E work sometimes, because talk cheaper than tanks. But if e no work, plan B na prayer chain, from mosque to church, everybody begging for peace. See, faith no dey selective; e cover all grounds, even international borders.

The fuel tariff flip-flop na classic. Announce with fanfare, withdraw with apology note. Why the rush? Because empty tank no respect policy paper. Drivers dey park, queues winding like river Niger, and economy dey cough. Reversing save face, but question remain: who advise the first move? E be like cooking soup without tasting—hot, then too bland. At least now, importers breathe easy, and we hope price no jump again. Tie this to doctors, same urgency. Strike dey, patients suffer, so negotiation table hot. Dem promise end soon, with better pay and conditions. Good, because health no wait for budget approval. In all, e show say pressure cook solutions, but better if dem plan ahead like good shepherd watching flock.

Celebrating Babangida at 84 na reminder of journeys long. From uniform to suit, power to reflection. Wishes pour in, showing respect for time served. E inspire, make one think of own path. At 84, e still sharp, unlike some young ones wey tire from stress. Neutrality in Anambra add layer, proving sometimes silence golden. APC praise it, opposition grumble, but balance maintain. Through it, faith whisper: endure, for seasons change but wisdom last.

These pieces fit puzzle of daily grind. Switching sides, dodging threats, fixing flips—all part of rhythm. We laugh to cope, because tears no solve. And in laughter, find grace that holds. Like Proverbs say, joyful heart na good medicine. So, as wahala turn, we turn with am, eyes up, hearts light. Who knows, next twist might bring breakthrough, or at least better joke material. But one thing sure: in this dance, we no fall, because higher power lead the step.
