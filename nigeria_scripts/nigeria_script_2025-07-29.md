Oya, pull up a chair, my people! You know the vibes. Another week, another episode of "Nigeria, We Hail Thee," brought to you by yours truly, Chijioke Eze, the comedian who tries to make sense of this... *gestures vaguely* ...this whole thing.

Eh, I don see una comments online o! Reddit, Nairaland, una dey vex. This week, the topic na… wetin again? Ah, AI-generated content! See, as if we don't have enough problems, robots wan come steal our jobs now. Abeg, let them try generate NEPA bill first, then we go talk. Make them generate constant light for one month, I go personally crown them king.

And Tinubu dey reward the Super Falcons. Well deserved? Of course! Nine times dem don win, and nobody even cough. Now dem dey spray money. E good, but make we no forget the real MVP na consistency. Government, try dey consistently fund sports, ehn? No be only election time una remember say we get athletes.

Speaking of consistency, I hear say Buhari is… *clears throat, pauses for dramatic effect* …still resting. Abi dem don change am to permanent vacation? Na since when I hear the man is still "resting" I don dey wonder, which kain sleep be that? You sleep pass Rip Van Winkle. Maybe dem fit him with solar panel. He just dey charge.

Then I see one thread on Nairaland, "What rich Nigerians understand that you do not." Omo, plenty things! First, dem understand how to legally avoid taxes. Second, dem understand say NEPA bill na suggestion, not law. Third, dem understand say you fit build road to your house using government money and call am "corporate social responsibility." O wrong nau!

Na true say religion dey be obstacle for development sometimes. See, I remember one time, I dey travel for Christmas, road block everywhere. Police dey harass people for money. I tell one officer, "Oga, Jesus no teach us this one o!" He look me one kind and say, "My friend, Jesus no buy patrol van either!" Wait, what?! I just pack my things and give am the money. Argument don end.

And this theology wey dem dey use for control… E dey everywhere o! From Mexico to Nigeria. People go dey shout "Amen!" while dem pocket dey empty. We need more critical thinking, less blind faith. But I go talk am, some pastors get better jokes than me. Almost make me change profession. Almost.

One good news though, I see say one LGA for Lagos built school. This one dey sweet my heart. This na wetin we need. But make we no clap too much. Dem build am now, next year dem go say dem need renovate. The renovation budget go pass the original construction cost. Na so we dey do things for Naija.

You know, somebody ask me the other day why nobody talks about Nigerian history. I tell am say, "My brother, Nigerian history na soap opera! Full of twists, turns, betrayal, and plot holes the size of Third Mainland Bridge." We need to teach our children about our past, the good, the bad, and the ugly. So dem no go repeat the same mistakes wey we don dey repeat since Independence.

But wait, I remember one thing. Remember that AI discussion? I just realize say if AI dey write jokes, e go probably write better jokes than our politicians dey tell us every day. Because at least the AI go be programmed to be logical. These politicians... their logic dey miss road like danfo wey lost him conductor!

Las las, Nigeria go survive. We dey resilient like cockroach wey survive nuclear blast. We just need to laugh to keep from crying. So, drink up, my people! Another round for everybody! Except for the politicians... dem dey drink enough already.
