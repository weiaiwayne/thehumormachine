Ah, my people, make una hear this one wey dey make my head spin like okada wey tire burst for pothole. You sabi that big oga for Bayelsa, the one wey suppose dey lead the charge for that party wey don turn ghost? E just jump ship go the other side, like say na market woman wey see better price for neighboring stall. Imagine, one day you dey wear blue cap, next morning e don turn yellow, shouting fresh slogans. Shey na so politics be? Or e be say the grass don turn greener where the money dey flow? Me, I dey wonder if e get small juju involved, because which kind U-turn be this one wey no get accident? And the followers, dem dey clap like say na Nollywood plot twist, but deep down, everybody dey ask: wetin next? If captain fit jump, who no fit follow?

That one dey remind me of this wahala with our doctors, the resident ones wey dey hold the stethoscope like weapon. Government don move to end the strike, abi? Finally, after months of bed dey empty for hospitals, and patients dey turn prayer warriors instead of see specialist. E sweet pass first rain after dry season, but wait o, how dem go do am? Dem go throw small money, promise better pay, and hope say the white coat no go vex again. You know how e be for here – strike start like fire, end like candle wey wind blow. I dey pity the patient wey go theater now, praying say the surgeon no dey think of another walkout mid-operation. And me sef, if I catch fever, I go first check Bible before I dash hospital, because even angels fit tire if salary no dey.

Speaking of promises wey dey fly like kite for harmattan, make una hear about this energy investment wey land $8 billion. Yes, eight billion dollars, not kobo o. Big companies dey come pour money into our power sector, like say dem see gold for the blackout wey we dey manage with torchlight. But e get one question wey dey my mind: where e go reach? Because last time dem talk big investment, we still dey use gen for wedding, and fan dey spin slow like tired lizard. Shey this one go light up the whole place, or na just another story wey go add to our testimony sessions? Imagine, church go turn disco hall because light no dey take leave again. And if e work, praise the Lord, because darkness no fit hide thief, but e fit hide politician wey dey chop the money.

Now, let me yarn una small about this hunger matter for the North, that documentary wey dey show empty plates and long queues for palliatives. E pain heart, eh? Families dey gather round one wrapper of garri, sharing like say na last supper. But see the twist – while dem dey beg for sack of rice, some oga for top dey negotiate crude oil deal with that refinery giant, extending naira payment like say na favor. Naira-based, no dollar wahala, but wetin e concern the farmer wey no fit plant because flood don carry everything? I dey laugh in tears, because one side dem dey talk economy boom, other side belle dey sing national anthem empty. And us, we dey manage, turning proverb to prayer: God go provide, even if na through miracle of multiplying one tuber of yam.

E get this other side wey dey vex me – that pro-Tinubu group wey dey drag that American president-elect, Trump, for his mouth on our matter. Dem say his comment na lie, unfounded like juju story wey no hold water. Imagine, foreign oga talk small about our challenges, and our own defenders jump up like say na personal attack. But truth be say, e no far from wetin we dey live daily – unemployment wey dey chase graduate like dog after cat, and projects wey dey favor one zone pass the rest. Shey na one country, or na selective blessing? That one time I hear say the big man meet World Bank chiefs for Abuja, I think say e go rain opportunity, but e still dey same old dance: promise, wait, then small change wey no reach everybody.

You know, for all this palava, e dey remind me of that Bible story where David face Goliath with small stone, no armor. Our leaders dey promise mountain-moving faith, but e end up like sling wey miss target. Yet, we no dey give up – we dey pray, hustle, and laugh to survive. Because if you no laugh for the middle of storm, wetin remain? Even when the queue for fuel turn marathon, or the market price climb like Mount Everest, grace dey there, whispering say better day dey come. Not from politician manifesto, but from above, where no party switching or strike dey disturb.

Ah, and this teen wey dey make waves, extraordinary one from our soil, doing things wey shock the world. While elders dey switch sides like chameleon, this young blood dey build empire with brain and grit. E inspire me, because if kid fit shine for midst of all this, then hope no lost. Imagine if politicians learn from am – no jumping ship, just steady progress. But nah, dem go rather form alliance wey no last, like marriage wey no get honeymoon.

One more thing before I wrap this yarn: that talk about helping our Christian brothers for here, e touch soul. In a place where crisis dey everywhere, from hunger to power play, faith na the anchor wey no dey shake. Dem ask how to help, and answer simple – share the little, pray hard, and stand together. No be by big money alone, but by love wey no dey count tribe or zone. Because at the end, when all the politics dust settle, na the heart wey dey pure go inherit the real kingdom, not the one with faulty borders.

So, my people, as we dey navigate this our journey, make we hold faith tight, laugh loud, and remember: even if governor dump party, God no dey change address. And if Trump talk rubbish, we go reply with our own style – prayer and pepper. Peace out, and may your hustle turn blessing sharp sharp.
