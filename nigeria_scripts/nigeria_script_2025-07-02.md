Oya, oya, gather round, gather round! Make una pull chair! My name is Chijioke Eze, and welcome to 'Wahala Wednesday'! Today, we dey dissect the koko of our Naija matter, ehn?

So, how many of you don see say, Nigeria, she’s like that aunty wey always dey promise to bring you something from abroad, but when she come back, na only story you go hear? “Ah, Chijioke, my pikin, the market was too full, I couldn't find your toy!” Story!

President Tinubu, Baba Agbado himself, still dey try to ‘jaga jaga’ the economy into shape. And you know what that means, right? More promises! More committees! More acronyms that nobody understands! I swear, if they put another “Presidential Task Force on Economic Revitalization and Harmonization of Inter-Agency Synergies” (PTFERAHIS) I go vex!

The opposition? Hah! Them dey like NEPA. Always promising light, but na darkness we dey see. Them dey quarrel among themselves, like children fighting over gala inside danfo. 2027 dey come, but right now, dem no fit even organize a proper owambe, talk less of running a country.

And talking about running a country, have you seen the price of rice lately? Kai! My mama called me last week, she said, “Chijioke, ah ah, you don become celebrity, you no dey remember your roots again? Rice wey I dey use cook jollof for you since you small, e don pass your salary o!” My salary o! As a comedian! This country will humble you, as one guy put it on Reddit. True talk!

Speaking of Reddit, some people dey ask how to handle AI generated content. Me, I dey more worried about how to handle fuel subsidy generated wahala! Make we settle the physical first before we start to dey fear the digital, abi no be so?

I see one guy on Nairaland dey ask what business him fit start with 5 to 6 million naira. My brother, with that kind of money, you can buy a politician. I swear, you fit buy a whole local government chairman! Okay, maybe not buy, but you fit definitely “influence” them. *Winks*

Remember that time government promised to give scholarships to deserving students? Wait, what? Deserving students? In Nigeria? Since when? Na who dem dey try fool? Last time I checked, na connection and long legs be the criteria! You know, "My uncle knows somebody who knows somebody who is dating the daughter of the Minister of…." You get the gist.

But seriously, Nigeria, ehn? We dey try sha. We dey hustle. We dey find our way. Like that guy wey say e wan make $1000 in two months. I respect the hustle! Even if e end up selling gala and pure water for Oshodi, the spirit is there!

But, make I tell una a true story. Last month, I dey drive for Lekki, and this police officer stop me. He look my car, he look my face, and he say, "Oga, your particulars?" I bring out all my papers, everything complete. Then he look me again, and he say, "Oga, you sabi say you don bribe me before?"

I was like, "Ha! Officer, I swear I no remember!"

He say, "No worry, you go remember now. How much you wan give me today?"

Wait, what? He wanted me to remember a bribe? In Nigeria, even the police dey use callback! See my life!

So, to all my brothers and sisters wey dey Naija, and even una wey dey Canada trying to build a Nigerian community, remember say… Nigeria will humble you. But we go survive. We go laugh. And we go continue to dey jaga jaga until we build the better Naija wey we dey dream of. Abi I lie?
