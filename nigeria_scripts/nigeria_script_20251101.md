Ehen, my brothers and sisters, imagine this: our big man up there goes all the way to France, rubbing shoulders with that sharp French fellow, Macron, like they're plotting to turn the Eiffel Tower into a giant suya spot. You think it's just handshakes and photo ops? No o, they're talking real deals, investments pouring in like rain in Calabar, eight billion dollars worth for our energy sector. Eight billion! If that money fixes even half the blackouts we face, I'll personally dance azonto on the next flight back. But wait, coordination? Our climate plans are scrambling like okada riders in a downpour, nobody knows who's steering the ship. Shey you feel me?

Now, shift gears to this PDP wahala, their convention hanging by a thread because they paused screening aspirants. Paused? Like say somebody pressed the remote control on politics. These folks gather, dreaming of comebacks, but it's all threats and drama, sharper than a tailor's scissors. Me, I dey wonder: if they can't even screen their own people without chaos, how dem go screen out the mess in the streets? It's like trying to organize a wedding in a market square, everybody shouting, nobody listening. And the hunger up north? That documentary dey hit hard, families scratching for crumbs while the world watches. But e get one thing wey dey keep us going: that quiet faith that turns scarcity into testimony, you know, like manna from heaven dropping unexpected.

Speaking of unexpected, picture this energy boom with NNPC and that refinery giant hashing out deals to keep crude flowing in naira. Naira! Not dollars chasing us like debt collectors. This could mean cheaper palm oil in the pot, less queueing for that yellow stuff. Yet, oil unions are pushing back, challenging every clause like wrestlers in a ring. Why? Fear of job shake-up, or just old grudges boiling over? In our land, every progress comes with a fight, eh? Reminds me of how we hustle daily, turning small wins into feasts. And through it all, grace steps in, whispering that redemption follows the struggle, even if politicians forget to mention it.

E get this one tourist asking how to bounce from the capital to that ancient city up north, no flying, just ground adventure. Tourist o! Coming to experience our vibes, dodging potholes like pros, maybe hopping on a bus that sways more than a church choir. But in truth, that journey tests your soul, hours stretching like elastic, stories swapping with strangers who become family by the end. It's pure Nigerian spirit, resilient, full of tales. Yet, amid the bumps, I remember that biblical road to Damascus, how one twist changes everything. Our paths may twist too, but hope lights the way, abi?

Now, let's talk that northern hunger crisis properly, not just headlines, but the real ache in bellies. Documentary shows kids with eyes too big for their faces, lands cracked like broken promises. While leaders jet to Japan and Brazil, shaking hands for aid, we're here praying for rain that nourishes fields and hearts. Extraordinary teens rising from it all, inventing ways to farm smarter, turning dust to green. That's the spark, you see, that divine ingenuity God plants in us. Politicians may fumble coordination on climate, but these young ones? They're the real MVPs, scripting comebacks with bare hands.

And don't get me started on this Igbos in the commercial hub talk, calling unity a dream. One side yells mirage, the other pushes projects that feel slanted, like the whole country is tilting toward one corner. Is it favoritism or just optics gone wrong? Me, I laugh because in family, we argue over the last piece of puff-puff, but blood ties us tighter. Same here, coexistence challenged, yet we weave through, Sanwo-olu style, navigating the chaos with that Lagos hustle energy. Faith in the mix, reminding us of olive branches after floods, grace mending what divides.

Ehen, then there's the World Bank chiefs visiting the capital, all suits and stats, promising fixes for jobs that vanish like smoke. Unemployment tackling? USA style versus ours, it's like comparing Ferrari to okada. They say two years too short to heal wounds, replying to those international money folks with fire. But realistic? In our reality, youth idle, skills rusting while dreams gather dust. Yet, I see it: that prodigal son vibe, returning stronger, faith turning job hunts into miracles. We rise, not by policy alone, but by believing in turnaround.

Crazy things unfolding, funny but true, like Christians seeking ways to aid brothers in need. How? Simple acts, sharing rice, whispering prayers that echo Psalms. No grand schemes, just heart. And that drummer's confession? Beating rhythms that pulse with our condition, every thump a story of survival. Ranking foods? Pounded yam reigns, but even that needs steady power, which circles back to those energy talks, investments hopefully sparking lights that stay on.

This coexistence challenge, dangerous vibes in the bustling state, but we thrive in tension, turning threats to triumphs. One Nigeria? Mirage or mosaic, it's ours to shape. With subtle grace guiding, like light in darkness, we laugh through the storm.

Finally, my people, as Macron chats with our envoy, deals sealing, remember: even in policy puzzles and union tussles, that higher power orchestrates, turning eight billion into blessings for all. No more hiding from shadows; we step bold, faith-fueled, ready for whatever twist comes next. And if unity feels like a joke, well, the punchline is us, standing tall, unbreakable.
