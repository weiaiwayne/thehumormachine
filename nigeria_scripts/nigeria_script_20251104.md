Ah, my people, make una hear this one wey dey sweet pass fresh akara with pap on Sunday morning. You sabi that governor from down south, the one wey decide say enough of that old party wey dey drag leg like old man wey forget im walking stick? E jump ship go the other side, like say na football match and e see say im team dey lose 5-0. Now, everybody dey ask, wetin next? E go chop plenty rice and stew for the new camp, or na just change of uniform without changing the dance steps? Shey you understand? Because for this our matter, politicians dey switch sides faster than okada rider wey dey dodge pothole for rainy season.

That one no too shock me sha, but the real wahala na how e go affect the small man like me wey dey hustle every day. Imagine, you dey there, trying to sell your tomatoes for market, and suddenly the price jump up because big men dey play musical chairs with power. E no be joke o, because last week, I hear say dem dey talk about hunger up north, like say the ground don decide to strike. Documentary even come out, showing people wey dey look for food like lost sheep for wilderness. And me, I dey think, if even the Bible talk say man no fit live by bread alone, wetin we go do when even the bread no dey? We go pray harder, abi? Because grace no dey take holiday, even when the stomach dey sing high notes.

Now, shift gear small, make I yarn una about this meeting wey dey brew between our leader and that American oga wey dey come back like sequel to bad movie. Dem say e go happen soon, with talks about security wey dey make everybody sweat. Insecurity concerns, like say bandits and all those rough boys no dey hear word. And the pro-group for our side dey fire back, say the American comments na pure 419, misleading like fake prophet wey promise miracle money. I laugh tire, because if na so, why dem still dey plan to shake hands? E be like say na business as usual, chop meeting, sign paper, and come back to same old story. But e sweet me say at least, dem go travel, see new places, while we here dey manage with what God provide. Redemption no dey come from abroad, e dey from up, where no visa wahala.

Ehen, that remind me of another gist wey dey hot like pepper soup wey dem forget to cool. Our country don secure big money for energy, like 8 billion dollars wey go light up things proper. Investments, talks with refinery people to keep supplying crude with local money, no more dollar drama. Sound good, right? But wait first, you know how these things dey go. Dem announce am with fanfare, like say tomorrow everybody go get light steady, no more darkness wey dey chase sleep away. Next thing, you wake up, your bulb still dey blink like e dey Morse code message to angels. And the small business owner like my sister wey dey run salon, e go mean she fit iron hair without generator noise disturbing neighbors. But shey e go happen quick-quick, or na another promise wey go hang like unripe mango? I dey hope, because faith without work na just daydream, and God no dey like laziness.

Make I no forget this one wey dey touch heart proper, about helping our brothers and sisters wey dey follow Christ for this land. People dey ask, how to lend hand to Christians facing heat? E no easy, with all the challenges wey dey fly around like mosquitoes for harmattan. But e sweet when you see community come together, share what little dem get, like the early disciples wey dey break bread. No be show-off, na quiet giving wey bring smile. And for comedy sake, imagine if politicians learn that one, instead of sharing only during campaign season. E go be miracle bigger than turning water to wine, because dem go turn promises to action without wahala.

Now, let me paint picture for una mind eye about this youth wey dem call extraordinary, this teen from our soil wey dey making waves. E no be small thing o, to stand out in crowd wey everybody dey try survive. Dem yarn say e get talent wey dey shine like star for night sky, and me I dey clap for am, because if one person fit rise, e mean others fit follow. But the truth na, for this economy wey dey squeeze like lemon, even extraordinary people dey need extraordinary help. Unemployment dey bite hard, like dog wey no eat for days. And the powers that be dey reply to big international bodies, say fixing issues no fit happen in two years flat, e dey take time like brewing good palm wine. Realistic, abi? But for the graduate wey dey hawk pure water for street, time no dey side.

Shift to this talk about lopsided projects, where people dey murmur say the top man dey favor one spot over others. E be like say the whole land na one big family, but some children dey chop more jollof than others. Wait, no be jollof, but you catch my drift. And for the east side, voices dey rise say unity na just mirage, like water wey you see for hot road but no reach am. Igbos for that commercial hub dey feel the pinch, asking if na fair play. E pain me, because we suppose be one body, no part dey suffer while other dey feast. But in the spirit of grace, we go forgive and push forward, because bitterness no dey build bridge, e dey burn am.

Ehen, and this matter of coexistence wey the governor for that bustling state dey address, calling it challenged. Dangerous even, dem say, with all the hustle wey turn to hustle-bustle wahala. You know how e be, buses flying left and right, people dodging each other like game of dodgeball. But if we no coexist, wetin remain? War? No o, we go sit down, talk like family, remember say blood thicker than traffic jam. And for the drummer wey confess im life, e yarn about beats wey carry our stories, from market to church. That one inspire me, because even in rhythm of struggle, there dey hope wey no fade.

One more thing before I wind down, this funny but true video wey dey go round, showing slices of our daily life wey make you laugh and cry same time. E capture the essence, like say na mirror for soul. And for the 36 states matter, people dey yarn about follow-for-follow, but real connection na what count. No be online like, na real support wey lift brother up. In all this, I dey see God's hand, weaving threads of redemption through the mess. Politicians may dump parties like old clothes, hunger may knock, but faith dey stand firm, like rock wey no shake.

Ah, my people, if all these no make you smile through the tears, then check your heart, because laughter na medicine wey no dey expire. And remember, even when plans shift like sand, the ultimate plan from above no dey fail. So, we go keep pushing, keep praying, and keep finding joy in the small wins. Peace!
