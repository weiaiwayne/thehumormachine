Omo Naija, how una dey? Chijioke Eze, live and direct!

Ehen, so I’ve been digging through the trenches of the internet this week. Reddit, Nairaland, the whole shebang. Omo, my head dey spin. You know say Naija no dey disappoint when it comes to giving us content, especially political content. Na everyday soap opera.

So, Peter Obi and Atiku… dem still dey shuffle alliances like say na card game. 67 registered political parties? 67! Ah, God. Imagine the ballot paper for 2027. You go need magnifier just to find your party. Wetin be this? Party congress or national census? And dem dey fight over who will handle AI content. Guys, before we dey worry about AI, wetin about real intelligence for government? Just asking.

Speaking of government, una hear about Edo state? Supreme Court don stamp am, Monday Okpebholo na di guvnor. Congratulations to am o! Hope e go remember the masses wey dey sweat under the sun. But seriously, Monday Okpebholo? Na name be that? E sound like wetin dem dey sell for Oshodi market. No offense to the Okpebholos dem, but ehn, Naija names ehn, na movie.

I saw one post online, somebody dey vex say Peter Obi supposed to inform the governor before e waka enter state. Inform governor ke? Na wetin? Peter Obi na visitor wey dey come for visa interview? He’s a citizen! Since when did we start needing permission to dey waka inside our own country? Na wa o. Na so so backwardness dey worry us.

And that hypocrisy of the West… ehn, don’t even get me started. Dem dey preach democracy, meanwhile dem dey do their own thing. And our leaders? Dem dey chop the bait like say e no get bone. We dey allow them to dictate to us, wey we be the giant of Africa! Giant wey dey sleep face down.

You know, something similar happened to my cousin. She traveled to the UK for the first time last year. She saw pothole on the highway, she wanted to call LASTMA. She nearly passed out when I told her that LASTMA don't operate in the UK. Then I asked her, so why are you here?

But the real killer be say, somebody post on Reddit say dem sister dey cry because dem deport am back to Naija from UK! She dey find remote job now. Remote job ke? For where? Naija wey light no dey gree stay for two hours straight? Omo, the irony fit choke person. But ehn, Naija go humble you. One minute you dey abroad dey flex, next minute you dey back here dey hustle like say tomorrow no dey.

And the corruption? Ha! Dem dey fight subsidy corruption, another one dey pop up. Corruption na like hydra, you cut one head, two dey grow back. Do we still get values? I dey ask una o! Abi we don sell am all for dollars?

Wait, wait… I just remember something. You know that one time I went to Abuja to perform for one politician’s birthday? Ehn, after the show, dem give me envelope… I open am, na dollar bills o! I dey smile like say I win lottery. Then I look down, I see one small note inside. You know wetin e write? "Please vote wisely." Wait, WHAT? So, dem dey bribe me to vote for them *after* dem don bribe me with the show? Na wa o!

Omo, Naija, we need deliverance! We need to wake up from this madness. We need to hold our leaders accountable. We need to demand better. Because if we continue like this, ehn, 2027 go be like Nollywood movie – full of drama, but no sense.

But ehn, despite all the wahala, I still love my Naija. Because where else you go see people wey dey laugh even when dem dey suffer? Na only for Naija, my people! Keep hustling, keep smiling, and keep voting… wisely, this time! Oya, let me hear una! Who be the best comedian in Naija? Na me nau!
