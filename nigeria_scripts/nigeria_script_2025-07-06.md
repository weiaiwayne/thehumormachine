Ehhen, my people, good evening, o! Chijioke Eze, live and direct from… well, from my living room today. Fuel scarcity still tight like my village uncle’s handshake. So, studio is a no-go area.

So, I was browsing Reddit this morning, r/Nigeria dey hot! Dem dey argue about AI-generated content. Ha! Nigeria, we don’t even have stable power to *generate* content, you dey worry about AI? Focus, people! Focus! First, make sure NEPA no carry light while you dey type that your deep philosophical take.

Then I saw another post, Governor *waka* all the way to Brazil to welcome Super Eagles. To Brazil! Meanwhile, road to my village, Ogun State... na adventure park. Somebody tell that Governor say, sometimes, charity begins at home. Or at least, tarring begins at home. That Brazil trip, na photo op, nothing more. Wetin concern Ogun state with Brazil immediately after the elections? Is he going to coach the team?

Speaking of elections, that matter still dey court, abi? Coalition this, appeal that... Na so dem go dey dance around the issue till 2027 when another set of dramas go start. Politicians, ehn? Dem be like mosquitoes; dem no dey ever leave you alone.

And women in politics? Don't even get me started. Still struggling to get a seat at the table. The table wey dem dey cook jollof rice wey everybody dey chop! It's like saying you can't eat the jollof if you didn't cook am.

Speaking of jollof, I went to a wedding last week. Ah, the struggle to find a husband! One Reddit post dey ask about likelihood of finding husband at a wedding. My sister, likelihood is about the same as NEPA giving you 24 hours of uninterrupted light. Possible, but don't hold your breath. I see one babe, package complete, everything on point, but she spend whole wedding dey snap pictures for Instagram. Babe, leave Instagram, look around! Your husband no dey Instagram, him dey for the dance floor, spilling Star beer on your aunty's gele!

You know, I saw one oyinbo man on Reddit, he dey complain say his Nigerian girlfriend dey brainwash him. Brainwash? Maybe she just dey *train* you to understand the Nigerian way of life. Because Nigeria, my brother, is not a country, it’s a masterclass in survival. You think you know suffering? Wait till you try to buy fuel on a Monday morning.

Speaking of suffering, I saw one ad for Lekki apartments, 150 million Naira, and dem still dey empty! 150 million! For that kind of money, I can buy a small island, declare myself president, and ban okada. Wait, what? Did I just say I want to be president? Chei, Naija don dey enter my head.

But seriously, 150 million? I remember when I was struggling to pay my rent in Yaba, landlord was shouting like say I kill his pikin. Now, people dey leave houses wey cost more than the GDP of some African countries empty. Something is not adding up, my people. Something is not adding up.

Anyway, make I no stress myself too much. Make I go find fuel for my generator. Because NEPA… well, you know the story. Naija, we dey smile through the pain. But sometimes, the pain dey too much. Even for comedian like me.
