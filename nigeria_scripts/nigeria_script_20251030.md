Ehen, imagine our oga at the top, President Tinubu, landing in France, rubbing shoulders with Macron as if dem dey share secrets on turning baguettes into gold mines. You see this handshaking? E be like dem dey plot to export our pepper soup to Paris, while back home, people still dey queue for rice wey cost arm and leg. Macron probably asking, "Bola, wetin una dey do with all that oil money?" And Tinubu replies with that signature smile, "E dey work, my brother, e dey work." But seriously, after all these trips, when go we see the magic? Abi, France go send us Eiffel Tower replica to fix our roads? Na wa o, international love no reach pocket level yet.

Now, shift gear to this Rivers State matter with Fubara. The man dey eye comeback, but APC wan scatter everything with threats flying left and right like market touts fighting for space. E get as e be: Fubara wan return, dem say no, you no fit, we go block you. Shey na film script or real life? Politicians dey turn state house into wrestling ring, complete with body slams and referee wahala. Fubara probably sitting there thinking, "I fought for this seat, now dem wan evict me like overdue tenant." And the threats? "If you try am, we go do this, we go do that." As if say power na personal property, no be public service. Me, I dey wonder: if dem succeed in chasing am, who go fix those potholes wey swallow cars whole? Or e go be another round of musical chairs with new face, same old dance?

Speaking of party drama, PDP sef no dey sleep. Dem halt screening for aspirants, convention hanging like sword of Damocles. Everybody wan run, but nobody wan wait for clearance. E be like wedding preparation where bride and groom dey fight over guest list before the ring. "You no fit contest until we check your CV from 1999." Aspirants sweating, lawyers sharpening pencils for court dates. PDP, una wan win election or na internal Olympics? The halt dey make sense? Or e just another way to weed out the weaklings before the big fight. But truth be say, when parties dey busy fighting themselves, the real winners sit back with popcorn, watching the show. And us, the voters? We dey left with choices wey no sweet pass bitter kola.

Then enter Senate President Akpabio, stirring pot with actions wey spark fire everywhere. The man moves, and controversy follows like shadow on sunny day. Recent moves don turn National Assembly into gossip central, everybody asking, "Wetin e dey do?" From bill passages to side comments, e full ground. Akpabio, you be like that uncle for family meeting wey says one thing, but everybody hears another. Controversy? Na your middle name now. Senate supposed to be house of wisdom, but e dey look like market where bargaining na the main business. People dey talk, "This action too much, that one no reach." Shey e intentional or just the way the cookie crumbles? Me, I laugh because in our system, every big man must collect own share of heat. But heat too much fit burn the whole kitchen, abi?

Now, let's touch this energy investment matter. Nigeria pulls in eight billion dollars for power and oil plays. Sounds massive, right? Like manna from heaven dropping into our laps. NNPC and refinery folks in talks to stretch crude supply with naira deals, no more dollar wahala every time. Debt profile even dropping under current watch, small wins stacking up. But hold on, eight billion? Where e go land? We still dey experience those blackouts wey make night feel like eternal vigil. Or e go vanish into thin air like politician's promise after election? Imagine: money comes, projects start, then poof, next headline is "Investigation panel formed." Classic tale. Yet, I see hope in it, you know? Like biblical story of manna, enough for the day, trust for tomorrow. Even if light flickers, that inner light from above never dims. Politicians fit fumble the bag, but grace go cover the rest.

Wetin about this extraordinary teen from our shores making waves? Kid pulling feats wey shock the world, proving say talent no respect borders. In a country where youth hustle for survival, this one shines like star in broad daylight. Reminds me of David facing Goliath, small stone, big victory. We got plenty such stories buried under daily grind, waiting for chance to burst out. But system no always nurture am. Unemployment knocking on doors, yet gems like this teen exist. How we no celebrate more? Or e go take foreign spotlight before we notice? Na so e be: our best dey export themselves because home no ready. Still, faith says redeem the time, turn obstacles to stepping stones. That teen? Inspiration for every young blood dreaming big.

And this talk of helping Nigerian Christians? Queries flying, "How to support in tough times?" Persecution, struggles, yet spirit unbroken. E touch heart, because faith no be fair-weather friend. In market, church, or street, believers hold on, praying through storms. Politicians promise protection, but only divine shield holds water. Humor in it: even when enemies plot, God's plan laughs last. We dey help by standing firm, sharing love, not just words. Simple acts, like sharing meal or word of encouragement, build the kingdom stronger than any policy. No need for billion-dollar schemes; grace multiplies the little we have.

Shifting to travel vibes, somebody asking route from capital to northern city without wings. Tourist planning ground adventure, dodging skies for roads or rails. In our land, that journey na epic tale: buses bouncing over bumps, stops at every junction for bush meat or suya. No flying? Brave soul. You go pass villages where life moves slow, kids waving at passing tires. But caution: hold your wallet tight, because roadside "guides" plenty. And the heat? E go test your patience like Job in the bible. Yet, arriving feels like conquest, stories to tell for years. Tourists, welcome to the real flavor, not just postcards.

Crazy happenings everywhere, funny truths staring us in face. Like this debt decrease announcement: "Under administration, burdens lighten." Clap hands, but check your pocketbook. E sweet on paper, reality bites different. Or the refinery talks extending naira crude? Step forward, yes, but will it quench thirst for stable prices? We dey watch, hopeful yet skeptical. Reminds me of prodigal son returning, pockets empty, but father welcomes anyway. Maybe our economy get that redemption arc coming, who knows?

One more twist: Igbos in the commercial hub claiming unity na illusion. Tensions bubbling, "One country? Mirage in desert." Deep words, stirring debates at every corner. Lagos no be small matter, e pulse with diversity, yet cracks show. Politicians fan flames or quench? History teaches: division weakens, unity builds. Biblical wisdom: love neighbor as self, even when e tough. We no born to hate; we built to bridge. That mirage? Turn it to oasis with effort.

And this kid from the bustling city, incredible moves turning heads. Lagos born, world class. E show say from chaos comes creativity. In danfo rushes or street football, talent brews. Politicians, learn: invest in youth, not just speeches. Their energy go power the nation better than any generator.

Wrapping thoughts on these lopsided projects query: "President for whole or just one spot?" Allegations fly, balance questioned. Fair point, because development supposed spread, not cluster. Like man sharing bread, no favor one side. Senate, assembly, all eyes on equity. Faith angle: God impartial, rain falls on just and unjust. So should our resources flow.

Finally, this challenged coexistence speech from state helmsman. Deep talk on living together amid differences. Na truth: we mix, clash, yet survive. Humor saves usâ€”laugh at faults, forgive quick. In end, like grace covering sins, unity covers our divides. But if politicians no wise up, we go keep dancing this uneasy tango forever. Shey una see? Even in mess, God's got the punchline.
