Wetin dey happen for this our country sef, make person dey wonder if na film wey dem dey shoot. Imagine o, President Tinubu just wake up one morning and decide to hail the APC for staying neutral inside Anambra matter, as if say politics na referee wey dey blow whistle for World Cup final. Neutrality? Abeg, which kain neutrality be that one when everybody know say the game don already start and goals dey fly left and right. E be like say dem dey play chess but use football boot, confusion everywhere.

But wait, make I yarn una about this Trump wahala wey blow hot last week. Oga at the top for America, Donald Trump, open mouth talk say him go send military come scatter things here, like say Nigeria na some small backyard wey him fit bully anytime. Me I shock, I say wetin we do you? Is it the jollof wey we no share or the traffic wey we no invite you join? Next thing, our government summon all those foreign diplomats for Abuja, as if say na emergency family meeting. Dem siddon, dey talk, dey negotiate, and Tinubu himself come out to say everything dey under control, we dey handle am diplomatically. Diplomatic? Shey na that kain talk wey go make soldier drop gun and pick pen? But e good sha, at least nobody go say we no try. E remind me of those old Nollywood films where the hero go face the villain with sweet words instead of punch, and somehow the villain go turn friend. Who knows, maybe Trump go wake up tomorrow and say, ah Nigeria, una people too sharp, make I send investment instead of invasion.

Speaking on that note of surprises, see this Bayelsa oga wey dump PDP join APC, like say him see better grass on the other side. One day him dey there waving red flag, next day him don switch to broom, sweeping clean new path. Politics for Naija na like market bargaining, today you haggle for tomatoes, tomorrow you change stall if the price drop. But e no be small thing o, e fit shake the whole table. Imagine if everybody start switching like that, by next year, parties go dey empty like church after offering collection when pastor preach too long. But e sweet me say at least him get options, unlike some of us wey wake up and the only switch we fit do na from bed to floor when alarm no ring.

Ah, and no forget that shoutout to former military head Babangida as him clock 84. Tinubu send congratulations, praising the man like say him na living legend wey no go ever fade. 84 years? That na plenty time to see wahala come and go. Me I respect am, because surviving politics for 84 years na miracle by itself. E be like say God give am extra grace, the kind wey no dey finish even when life throw curveballs. You know, in the Bible dem talk about long life as blessing, but for Naija, long life in politics mean you don master the art of dodging bullets, literal and figurative. Happy birthday to am, may him continue to inspire us with that wisdom wey come from seeing too much.

Now, let me touch this matter of doctors strike wey government dey try end. Resident doctors fold arm, say no more work until dem pay salary and sort welfare. Fair enough, because who go treat person when hunger dey knock? Government now dey move, promising this and that, like say dem just discover say health na important. But e be like those promises wey politicians share during campaign, sweet to hear but hard to swallow when time come. Imagine o, you sick, go hospital, but doctor no dey because him own pocket dey empty. Na so life be here, one wahala chase the other. But e good say dem dey talk now, maybe soon e go settle and we fit breathe easy. E even make me think of that grace wey dey sustain us, the one wey say even in strike season, healing still come from above, whether from doctor or divine touch.

And talking about moving forward, see Sanwo-Olu for Lagos, him dey appeal to global investors about climate change. Him siddon there Thursday, yarn say come put money for green projects, make we tackle flood and heat together. Climate change for Lagos? Abeg, which one again, when we never finish battling the regular rain wey turn street to river every season? But e smart move sha, because investor money na the kind wey fit build bridges that no go collapse next rainy day. Him dey talk international, painting picture of sustainable future, but me I know say for ground zero, na the small boy wey sell pure water under sun go feel the real heat first. Yet, e inspire hope, like say even in the midst of environmental drama, there is room for redemption through smart planning. Who say Naija no fit lead? If we handle climate like we handle our parties, switching and adapting, then global stage go respect us proper.

But let me yarn una small gist about this NNPC and Dangote refinery deal wey dem dey extend, paying with naira for crude. Sound technical, but break am down, na like saying instead of dollar wahala, make we use our own money circulate. Good idea on paper, because foreign exchange no be toy, e dey make everything cost pass heaven. But in practice, e go work? Time go tell, but at least dem dey try localize the business, make it our own. E remind me of family gathering where everybody contribute from their pocket instead of borrowing from uncle abroad. If e click, then refinery go hum louder, and we fit export without the exchange rate biting us back.

You see, all these political twists and turns, from diplomatic dances to party jumps and birthday cheers, e show say life for here na endless script full of plot twists. But through it all, there is that quiet faith wey keep us going, the assurance wey say no matter how the story bend, the ending go be sweet if we hold on. Politicians may promise paradise, but true peace come from higher place, the one wey no dey shift like party colors. So, as we navigate these waters, make we laugh plenty, because laughter na the best medicine, even when doctors dey strike.

Now, imagine if Trump hear about our refinery deal and decide say, ah, una too wise, no need for military, make I come partner instead. That go be the ultimate twist, turning threat to trade overnight. But until then, we go keep watching, waiting, and wondering what next episode go bring. Stay sharp, my people, because in Naija politics, the only constant na surprise.
