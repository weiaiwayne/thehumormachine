(Chijioke Eze walks onto the stage, adjusts the mic, smiles wide. The crowd roars. He's wearing a stylish Ankara shirt and sharp trousers.)

Oya, oya! Lagos! Nigeria! How una dey? Eh? You dey feel am? The suffering? The shege? (Crowd laughs and cheers) Good, good. Glad to see we’re all on the same page. Because honestly, if you’re not feeling the shege right now, either you’re a politician or you’re dating one. And if you’re dating one, abeg, introduce me! My account balance needs deliverance.

So, 2025, eh? Almost halfway through this administration. Remember 2023? The elections? Ah, the drama! More twists than a Nollywood plot. We thought we were voting for a president, turns out we were auditioning for a reality show. And the prize? Another four years of, well, let’s just call it "economic experimentation."

(He pauses for effect, sips water.)

Speaking of economic experimentation, did you all see the latest inflation figures? Kai! My brother, it's climbing faster than a tout trying to jump into a danfo in Oshodi! They say it’s "transitory." Transitory? My friend, this inflation has become a permanent resident! It’s built a mansion in our wallets and is refusing to pay rent. We’re practically squatters in our own accounts!

And the exchange rate? Don't even get me started! It’s like a rollercoaster at Elegushi beach – scary, unpredictable, and you're pretty sure you're going to lose your lunch at some point. One minute it’s ₦800 to a dollar, the next it’s ₦1,200. At this rate, we’ll be trading our kidneys for dollars just to buy bread!

But you know what’s even funnier? The government’s solution! They’re always talking about "diversification." Diversify this, diversify that. As if diversification is some kind of magic potion that will solve all our problems. Oga, we’ve been diversifying since independence! We’ve diversified into corruption, we’ve diversified into insecurity, we’ve even diversified into jollof rice wars with Ghana! What else is left to diversify into? Maybe we should diversify into becoming a reality TV show country. We already have the drama, the characters, and the never-ending suspense.

(He leans into the mic conspiratorially.)

And the politicians, eh? They’re like Teflon. Nothing sticks to them. Accusations of corruption? They just dust it off like it’s dandruff. Public outcry? They say it’s "sponsored." Sponsored by who? The ancestors? Because at this point, I'm pretty sure even the ancestors are vexed with the way things are going!

Remember Senator Bola? The one who promised to build a bridge to the moon? Turns out the only bridge he built was a bridge into his own bank account! And when they confronted him about it, he said, "It's an investment in the future of space exploration." Space exploration? Oga, people are struggling to afford yam! Who has time to explore space when they're trying to survive on earth?

(He shakes his head, a touch of genuine frustration creeping in.)

It’s not even the corruption that vexes me the most, it’s the hypocrisy! They preach about patriotism while stashing money in foreign accounts. They talk about sacrifice while flying private jets to Europe for medical check-ups. They sing the national anthem with one hand while looting the treasury with the other. It’s like watching a comedy sketch written by Satan himself!

You know, I was talking to my mechanic the other day, Emeka. Emeka is a wise man. He said, "Chijioke, in Nigeria, the more things change, the more they remain the same. Only the actors change, the script remains the same." And you know what? He’s right! We keep recycling the same politicians, the same policies, the same problems. It’s like a broken record stuck on repeat.

(He raises his voice slightly.)

But the thing that gives me hope, the thing that keeps me going, is the resilience of the Nigerian people. We’ve been through so much, yet we still manage to laugh, to dance, to create, to survive. We’re like cockroaches – you can’t kill us! You can throw anything at us – bad government, economic hardship, insecurity – and we’ll still find a way to thrive. We’ll hustle, we’ll pray, we’ll find joy in the little things. That’s the Nigerian spirit!

And speaking of resilience, have you seen the new "Made in Nigeria" campaign? They’re trying to encourage us to buy local. Buy Nigerian products, support Nigerian businesses. Which is great in theory. But have you seen some of these Nigerian products? I bought a pair of shoes the other day that fell apart after one week! One week! I wore them to a wedding, and by the time I was doing the "gbese" dance, the sole had detached itself and run away! It was like the shoe was saying, "I cannot cope with this suffering anymore, I'm out!"

(He mimics the shoe running away, the crowd roars.)

And the funny thing is, the shoe was branded with a picture of a lion! A lion! The king of the jungle! This shoe was weaker than a newborn kitten! I went back to the shop to complain, and the shop owner said, "Oga, na Nigerian lion, e no get power!" Wait, what? Nigerian lion? Is that a new species? Are we now breeding weak lions? What is going on?!

(He pauses for the laughter to subside.)

But you know, even with all the wahala, I still love Nigeria. It’s a chaotic, frustrating, beautiful, maddening, amazing place. It’s home. And we have to keep fighting for it. We have to keep holding our leaders accountable. We have to keep demanding better. We have to keep believing that things can change.

Remember Senator Bola and his bridge to the moon? Well, maybe instead of building bridges to the moon, they should focus on building bridges to connect Nigerians. Bridges of understanding, bridges of tolerance, bridges of unity. Because that’s what we need. We need to come together, regardless of our tribe, our religion, our political affiliation, and build a better Nigeria for ourselves and for future generations.

And that, my friends, is no joke. Although, if they try to build another bridge to their bank accounts, I’ll be here to make fun of them. Because that’s what I do. I’m a comedian. It’s my job to laugh at the absurdities of life, to shine a light on the darkness, to make you think, to make you laugh, and to remind you that even in the midst of the shege, there’s always something to smile about.

So, thank you, Lagos! Thank you, Nigeria! Una too much! I’m Chijioke Eze, and I’ll see you next time, God willing, and if the politicians haven’t stolen all the money yet! Good night!

(He waves, bows, and exits to thunderous applause.)
