(Chijioke strides confidently onto the stage, microphone in hand, already grinning at the cheering crowd. He's dressed in a crisp, modern Ankara shirt and dark jeans.)

Ah! My people! Una good evening o! You dey feel alright? Lagos energy dey here tonight! I love it! I love it!

So, I see all of you… *checks the crowd* …are here tonight to laugh away the stress. Smart move. Because if you try to solve Nigeria’s problems with headache medicine, you’ll just end up with a calm headache. No solution!

Me, I’m Chijioke, your comedian for the evening, and I’m here to tell you the truth. Or at least, *my* version of the truth. Which, let’s be honest, is probably more accurate than what you see on Channels TV. No offence to my media friends… you're just saying what una oga says. We understand. We dey manage.

So, what’s been happening? Hmmm… Nigeria. Still Nigeria-ing. It’s like we’re trapped in a Nollywood movie that never ends. Just when you think the villain is defeated, *bam!* Plot twist! Another billion naira don vanish!

Speaking of money vanishing… remember last year, when dem say the NNPC… (bless their heart… I mean, bless their transparency… or lack thereof) … ‘misplaced’ a few billion dollars? Ehn? Misplaced! As in, like you misplaced your car keys? "Oops, I think I left my billion dollars in my other pocket." Kai! Which pocket is that? I need to start wearing those kind of trousers!

And then they did "recover" some of it. The Nigerian version of 'recover' is like finding a single grain of rice after your bag of rice fell into the Atlantic Ocean. You celebrate the grain, but you still dey hungry.

But you know what vexes me the most? It’s not even the missing money, it’s the explanations! The explanations are always more ridiculous than the crime itself. They’ll tell you it's "technical issues," "operational costs," or my personal favourite, "unforeseen circumstances." Unforeseen circumstances! Like say a battalion of ninjas jumped out and stole the money! At least give us a good story! We're Nigerians! We appreciate good storytelling!

My papa used to say, "Chijioke, a lie has to have at least *some* truth to it, otherwise it's just… entertainment." I think our politicians took that to heart. They are now master entertainers. Starring in the hit show: "Where Did All the Money Go?" New episodes air daily!

And the thing is, we keep falling for it! We complain, we shout, we trend hashtags on Twitter… and then we go back to our lives and forget about it until the next scandal. It's like we have national amnesia. Maybe that’s why they keep doing it. Because they know we’ll forget!

You know, I was talking to my friend, Emeka, the other day. Emeka is a proper Lagos hustler. He sells phone accessories in Ikeja. The guy can sell ice to an Eskimo! Anyway, we were discussing Nigerian politics (as you do when you're stuck in Lagos traffic for three hours), and Emeka said something profound. He said, "Chijioke, in Nigeria, the only thing that's recycled more than plastic bottles is politicians." Wait, what?

He has a point! These guys just rotate positions! Minister of this today, Senator of that tomorrow, consultant of the other thing the day after that! It's like a game of musical chairs, but with billions of naira as the prize! And the music never stops!

And speaking of music...remember the last election? All that singing and dancing! All the promises! "I will build a bridge to the moon!" "I will give every Nigerian a private jet!" "I will make garri cheaper than water!" And then they win the election and… silence! The only bridge they build is the one between their house and their bank account!

I saw one politician promising to create 10 million jobs in one year. 10 million! That's more jobs than Facebook, Google, and Dangote combined! I wanted to shout, "Oga, are you planning to employ aliens? Because there aren't that many Nigerians looking for work!"

I went to visit my village last month. My village is deep in the East. Like, you need GPS and a machete to find it. And even then, you might still get lost. I went to see my grandmother, Mama Ifeoma. Mama Ifeoma is… how do I put this… *very* traditional. She still believes that the internet is a conspiracy by the white man to steal our souls.

Anyway, I was telling her about all the problems in Nigeria – the corruption, the insecurity, the bad roads. And she just looked at me and said, "Chijioke, these problems are not new. They were here before you were born, and they will be here long after you are gone. The only thing that changes is the people who are doing the stealing." Mama Ifeoma dropping truth bombs like it's nothing!

But, honestly, she's right. We've been complaining about the same things for decades. The names change, the faces change, but the problems remain the same. So, what's the solution? I don't know! If I knew the solution, I wouldn't be here making jokes! I'd be in Aso Rock, collecting my own billions!

But seriously, I think the solution starts with us. We need to stop being so easily distracted. We need to hold our leaders accountable. We need to demand transparency and good governance. And most importantly, we need to remember! Remember all the promises they made! Remember all the money that went missing! Remember the ‘unforeseen circumstances’ of the NNPC!

We need to be like that neighbour that always knows what's going on and is never afraid to shout. "Ah ah! What is happening here? Explain yourself!" That's what Nigeria needs! A nation full of busybody neighbours, watching everything!

Because right now, we're like a family with a thief in the house, but nobody wants to say anything because they're afraid of causing trouble. But the thief keeps stealing! And eventually, there will be nothing left!

So, let's start paying attention. Let's start asking questions. Let's start demanding better. Let's start being the busybody neighbour that Nigeria desperately needs!

And maybe, just maybe, one day, we can finally get to the end of this Nollywood movie and live happily ever after. Or at least, live without constant power outages and pot holes the size of swimming pools.

But until then… *raises microphone* … laughter is the best medicine! So let me keep prescribing it for you. Who knows, maybe laughter can cure corruption too! It’s worth a try, eh?

Thank you, my people! Una too much! I love you all! Don’t forget to tip your comedian, because even comedians need to survive in this economy. God bless Nigeria! Even though she needs a serious intervention. Goodnight!
