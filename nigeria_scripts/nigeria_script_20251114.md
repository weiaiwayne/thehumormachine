Eh, my people, you hear this one wey dey make me shake head like plantain wey fall inside gutter? That American president-elect, Trump, wake up one morning and decide say e wan send army come dis our side, like say Nigeria na him backyard wey e go tidy up. Chai, see wahala! Him talk say if we no handle our matter well, soldiers go land here, maybe to fix road or chase bandit, who knows? But wait o, our own president Tinubu no waste time, e summon all those foreign envoys for Abuja, like say na family meeting wey everybody must attend. And now dem dey talk diplomacy, assuring say everything under control. Shey you understand? One man from over there dey threaten thunder and lightning, while we here dey respond with prayer and phone call. Me, I dey wonder, if Trump send drone come Lagos, e go first land for Oshodi or straight to Aso Rock? Because traffic no dey respect passport, you know.

That thing dey remind me of how our leaders dey play this party switching game like children wey dey chase butterfly. Take Bayelsa governor, Douye Diri, e just dump PDP like old wrapper and run go APC side, as if na better jollof dem dey share there. Ehn, yesterday na opposition, today na ruling party, tomorrow who knows? Maybe e go form own party called "Chair for All." See, in Nigeria, loyalty na like NEPA light – e come, e go, e flicker, but you never sure when e go stay. And APC dey hail Tinubu for staying neutral inside Anambra matter, like say e be referee wey no wan take side. Neutrality? That one sweet o, especially when election dey hot like pepper soup. But my brother, if everybody dey switch side like danfo driver wey see police, how we go know who be who? I imagine say if dem allow me run for office, I go switch party every market day – Monday APC for rice, Tuesday PDP for yam, Wednesday Labour for beans. At least, everybody go chop something.

Now, speaking of leaders wey dey try shine eye, see Lagos governor Sanwo-Olu, e dey appeal to investors for this climate change summit, talking big about green energy and sustainable future. Him say Lagos wan be global hub, attract money from everywhere to build solar panels and clean rivers. Beautiful talk, abi? But wait, make I ask: the same Lagos wey flood take over every rainy season, where people dey swim to office like Michael Phelps? Or where danfo buses dey pour black smoke like barbecue grill? E dey make sense say e wan fix environment, but shey dem go start by stopping those okada riders from turning Third Mainland Bridge into racetrack? Because if climate change na the enemy, then Lagos traffic na the boss level. And Tinubu meet regional minister over insecurity and projects, promising say dem go tackle bandit and build road. Hope say this time, the project no go be like those promise wey evaporate faster than water for sun. Even when things dey rough, I remember say in the Bible, David face Goliath with stone, no be AK-47. So maybe our leaders fit learn say small faith plus action go scatter giant problem, instead of just talk.

Eh, and this NNPC with Dangote refinery deal, dem dey talk to extend supply with naira, no more dollar wahala. Sounds good, right? Like finally, we go refine our own oil and pay with our own money, save foreign exchange. But me, I dey laugh because last time dem talk such thing, na so e be until queue for petrol start again. Imagine say the refinery dey work smooth, but NEPA take light just as dem wan pump – then wetin? Generator go drink the fuel wey suppose go market? Nigeria na puzzle, every solution bring new riddle. And on top of that, Tinubu respond to Trump threat by saying government dey engage diplomatically, no panic. Diplomatic engagement? That na big grammar for "we dey beg make you no vex." But seriously, if America wan send army, shey dem go come with AC or go suffer our heat like everybody? Because even soldier fit tire for Lagos sun, join queue for pure water.

You know how we Nigerians dey turn serious matter to joke? Like this Igbos in Lagos talk, where some say one Nigeria na illusion, like mirage for desert. But Lagos na melting pot, Igbo man dey sell spare parts for Idumota, Yoruba woman dey fry akara for street, Hausa guy dey push wheelbarrow for market – everybody dey hustle together. If one Nigeria na mirage, at least na shared suffering wey bring us close. And Sanwo-Olu talk about challenged coexistence, saying Lagos dangerous? Underrate am, governor! Dangerous na understatement – crossing road for Ikeja na own Olympics. But in all this, I dey find grace, you know? Like how Paul talk in scripture say in weakness, strength dey perfect. So when politician promise heaven but deliver pothole, we fit laugh and say God's plan bigger than their budget.

Now, let me yarn you about this extraordinary Nigerian teen wey dey make wave, but tie am to politics. See, while governors dey switch party like cloth, this young blood dey invent something wey go solve power problem – maybe solar gadget wey no need NEPA approval. If only our leaders fit borrow that energy, instead of waiting for IMF to tell dem how to fix economy in two years. Tinubu reply say unrealistic, and e true – our problem no be two-year affair, na generational stew wey dey boil since independence. But imagine if dem use that teen's brain for policy: no more blackout, no more generator noise waking baby at night. Instead, light everywhere, like heaven's glow. And for Trump threat, maybe send that teen to Washington with demo – show say we no need invasion, we get homegrown solution.

Eh, one more thing wey dey tickle me: Tinubu depart Abuja go Japan and Brazil, rubbing shoulder with world leaders, while back home, resident doctors dey strike again. Government move to end am, but shey dem go pay salary on time this round? Doctors no be magician, dem need fund to save life, no be promise. It's like pastor wey preach prosperity but church roof dey leak – everybody wan believe, but evidence dey lack. Yet, in faith, we hold on, knowing say redemption come after trial, like Easter after cross. So while politicians dey travel for summit, we here dey pray make doctor resume, make light stay, make peace hold.

Finally, my people, if Trump really send soldier, make dem know say Nigerian spirit no dey break easy. We go welcome dem with fufu and egusi, turn invasion to cultural exchange. But hopefully, diplomacy win, and we continue our beautiful wahala in peace. Because at the end, no matter the threat or switch, God's got the master plan – and e no dey need visa.
