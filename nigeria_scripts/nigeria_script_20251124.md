Wetin dey happen with this Anambra election matter, eh? You see how our oga at the top, Tinubu, just sit down there like neutral referee, no side, no wahala, just watching the match play out. Me, I dey wonder, if e be football game, dem for hail am as fair umpire, but in politics? Neutrality na like trying to sell akara without oil – e no dey work, e just dey smoke up everywhere. And the Lagos APC people, dem dey jump up, clapping hands like say na World Cup final. Neutral? Abeg, in Naija politics, neutral means you dey wait to see who win before you pick side, like betting man with inside gist. But Tinubu, you try, at least e no blow whistle too early.

Now, speaking of big men playing games, that Bayelsa governor, e just wake up one day and say, "PDP, I don tire, make I go APC side go chop better jollof." Dump party like old wrapper, jump fence to the other camp. Chai, this na the kind speed wey we need for danfo bus in morning rush, not for switching loyalties. You know how we Nigerians do am? One day you dey red, next day you dey green, as long as the pot dey sweet. But e get one thing: when e land for APC, dem hail am like hero returning from war, but me, I dey ask, wetin e carry go? Empty bag or full one? Politicians na like market traders, always repackaging the same old tomatoes to look fresh. And the people of Bayelsa, dem dey watch, shaking head, hoping say this switch go bring light steady or road wey no dey pothole every rainy season. But hope na like our generators – e dey there, but fuel scarce.

That one take me to this Trump matter wey dey make international noise. This American oga, e open mouth threaten military action, like say Naija na small boy wey need cane. And our government? Dem summon all diplomats for Abuja, like town hall meeting for village square. Tinubu respond say dem dey engage diplomatically, no shaking. Engage ke? Abeg, if na true war, dem for bring out amala and ewedu to settle matter, because talk-talk no dey fill belly. But e funny how Trump dey talk from far, as if e no sabi our history – we don face worse from inside, no need outside army to add pepper. And Tinubu, e dey assure say everything under control, like pastor wey dey pray for rain during drought. You see, even in this tension, e remind me say God's protection na the ultimate shield, no visa required, no threat from across ocean fit pierce that one. Politicians promise peace, but na divine grace wey keep us standing when storm blow.

Ah, and this Babangida birthday at 84, Tinubu send congratulation like old classmate note. IBB, the former military head, now grand oga, turning pages of life like old novel wey still dey sell. 84 years in Naija? That na achievement, because surviving our roads, our queues for rice, our ASUU strikes – e be like marathon wey no get finish line. Tinubu hail am, say e inspire, but me, I dey think, wetin e inspire? The way dem switch from uniform to agbada without missing beat? Or how e balance power like juggler with too many balls? But seriously, at 84, if I reach there, I go just dey thank God for every breath, because in this country, longevity na miracle, not just calendar count. No be small thing to see generations come and go while you still dey sip kunu in the morning.

Now, let's not forget this fuel import tariff U-turn by the government. Dem announce 15 percent, next thing, dem reverse like keke wey jam pothole. Why? Because the wahala too much, queues longer than Sallah line, prices jumping like frog for hot water. Nigerians no dey take dat kind play – we go protest with empty jerry cans banging like drum set. So, government blink first, say okay, we withdraw. But e be like say dem dey test water with one toe, see if e hot, then pull back. Me, I dey laugh, because if dem consult Bible, dem go see say even Pharaoh change mind too late. But here, na early U-turn, small win for the common man wey dey push okada every day. At least, e show say listening ear dey, even if e selective like choosing best okra from market heap.

And the resident doctors strike? Government dey move to end am, like referee wey wan blow whistle for extra time. Doctors fold arms, hospitals empty like ghost town, patients praying for quick settlement. Wetin dey cause am? Money matter, always the root, like tree wey no get water no go bear fruit. But imagine, while dem negotiate, we dey manage with herbal leaves and church prayers. E funny how in Naija, strike na normal, like NEPA taking light on cue. But this time, government step in fast, promising to pay what due. Hope say e stick, because health na wealth, and without doctors, na God own pharmacy we dey rely on – aspirin from heaven, no prescription needed.

Shifting gears, this NNPC and Dangote refinery talk for extending naira-based crude supply deal, e sound like business marriage wey dey renew vows. No more dollar wahala, just naira flowing like Niger River. Good news for once, because our currency don suffer enough, weak like pap wey no thick. But e make me think of how we always patch things – refinery deal today, tomorrow na another leak. Nigerians, we resilient sha, turning scarcity to strategy, like using lantern when power cut. Yet, in all this economic dance, e dey remind me of Proverbs wisdom: trust in the Lord for provision, because man-made deals fit shift, but heavenly bank never bankrupt.

You know, weaving through these headlines, e clear say our leaders dey try navigate ocean with canoe, paddling left, right, avoiding rocks. From Anambra calm to Bayelsa bounce, Trump noise to IBB cheers, tariff twist to doctors peace, refinery renew – na cocktail of drama wey fit make Hollywood jealous. But we, the people, we dey here, laughing through the storm, because if we no find humor, wetin remain? And deep down, that faith spark, e dey light the way, turning potential disaster to testimony. Like, even when threats loom, grace covers us thicker than bulletproof vest.

One more angle before I wrap this thought: this Igbos in Lagos talk, one Nigeria as mirage? Some say e be illusion, like oasis in desert. But Lagos na melting pot, Igbos building, trading, mixing with Yoruba, Hausa, everybody chopping same indomie. Mirage? Abeg, na reality wey dey sweat under sun. Politicians fan fire with lopsided projects gist – Tinubu favoring Lagos? But e be capital of hustle, where dreams no dey sleep. Me, I see unity in the chaos, like church service with different tongues praising same God. No be mirage, na mosaic, piece by piece forming picture wey beautiful when you step back.

And unemployment wahala with USA and Naija governments tackling am? Dem dey talk policy, but ground level, youth dey hawk recharge cards, waiting for miracle job. What dem doing? Training programs, loans wey no reach. But e funny, because in Bible, even fishermen turn apostles with net full of purpose. So, perhaps our tackle na faith plus action, not just talk from high table.

Finally, ranking Nigerian foods? Wait, that one no be politics, but e tie in – swallow wey go with any soup, like leaders wey fit any crisis. Pounded yam top, eba steady, but semo? E be underdog wey rise. Foods no dey switch party, dem just satisfy hunger steady.

Chai, in this 2025, with all these twists, if politics na comedy show, Tinubu na headliner, but we audience dey steal the laughs. And when curtain fall, na God's encore wey keep the house full.
