Eh, make I yarn una small gist wey dey hot pass fresh akara for market. You see this matter of leaders from different sides coming together, like say dem dey share juju secrets for high places? E get one oga from the East wey just show face for the center, shaking hands and smiling like e collect jackpot from Baba Ijebu. Dem call am Soludo, and e go visit the main man wey dey run the show. Now, wetin you think dey behind that visit? Abi na to beg for more roads or maybe to share ideas on how to make our pockets feel less empty? Me sef I dey wonder, because last time I check, e no be ordinary chop and go.

Now, imagine if that visit na like family reunion wey turn to argument over who owns the remote. One side dey talk say e don achieve plenty as oga for im state, building bridges and schools, while the other side dey boast say na im get the master plan for the whole country. But truth be say, as una dey yarn, we for ground still dey hustle for daily bread. E sweet me to think say maybe dem go discuss real things, like how to stop this wahala wey make young boys turn to yahoo instead of reading books. You know that feeling when you see your neighbor's son wey suppose dey university now dey code fake emails? Na so life dey push us sometimes.

Speaking of pushing, e get this noise everywhere say our top oga na some kind of foreign agent, like James Bond but with agbada. Dem talk say e dey work for American spies, CIA or wetin. Chai, if na true, then why una economy no dey work like Hollywood movie? For film, spies dey save the world with gadgets, but here, we still dey queue for rice wey price don climb like Mount Kilimanjaro. Me I laugh, because if e be spy, e suppose don hack our problems and fix am sharp sharp. Instead, we dey hear rumors wey fly faster than okada for pothole road. Shey you no see say na distraction? While dem dey argue spy or no spy, our youths dey jobless, wandering like lost sheep for village.

Ah, that brings me to this open message wey somebody send to the big man, like love letter but full of wahala. E be like say the writer dey pour out heart, talking say make im fix the mess wey dey ground. Wetin e talk? Make hunger stop, make jobs come back, make life sweet again. Na true talk, but e sweet to read am like Nollywood script where hero suppose win at the end. But in real life, letters like that just dey collect dust for office, while we dey market bargaining for tomatoes wey cost more than gold. I imagine the oga reading am, nodding head, then calling advisor say, "This one na joke, abi?" No be joke o, e be cry from the masses wey tire of empty promises.

Now, on the other side, dem dey celebrate big victory for some local race, calling am endorsement for the main team. Massive win, dem talk, like say na World Cup final. But wait, endorsement for wetin? For the hardship wey dey increase every day? Or for the way prices dey dance skelewu? If na endorsement, then make dem endorse better roads first, because last time I travel, my car tire burst three times before I reach home. We need win wey touch our daily grind, not just paper victory wey make dem feel like kings while we dey suffer like subjects.

E get this comparison too, between how America dey handle joblessness and how we dey do am here. Over there, dem get plans, training, money flowing like river Niger. Here, na prayer and hope, with small small programs wey no reach everybody. Why e no fit match? Abi na because our leaders dey busy with visits and letters instead of action? Imagine if we borrow their style, every graduate go get work, no more sitting for house watching big brother. But no, we dey manage with side hustles, selling recharge cards under bridge or braiding hair for roadside. E pain me, but e make me laugh how we turn masters of improvisation, like MacGyver but with pure water nylon.

And then, dem dey hail why this oga special, listing things e do before as state boss. Achievements like this and that, roads, markets, security. E sound good on paper, but when you drive through those roads now, potholes still dey swallow tires. Special how? If special mean making some shine while others cry, then yes. But me, I want special wey reach the common man, the one wey dey wake up 5am to farm or teach for underpaid school. Even in the Bible, dem talk say true leaders lift the lowly, not just shine for camera. So, make that specialness spread, abi?

You know, all this political dance dey remind me of our family gatherings, where uncles dey argue who go control the goat meat. Same way, these big men dey share power, but the meat no dey enough for all. And in the midst of it, we dey hold on with faith, because even when plans fail, there's grace wey carry us. Like that story of David facing giant, small boy win with belief. Maybe our leaders need that kind of faith, not just handshakes.

But let's yarn about unemployment proper, because e dey bite hard. Young graduates dey carry CV like market load, entering offices wey no dey open. Dem promise jobs, but na ghost work. Compare to USA, where dem train you, give loan, make you start business. Here, na "manage" and "God go provide." God dey provide o, but make una add effort na. Imagine if every politician wey visit another open factory, then unemployment go run comot. Instead, we dey hear by-election wins wey no change our CV.

E get this heaven of issues too, where everything dey wrong but dem dey act like paradise. Corruption no be new, but e dey everywhere now, like rain for rainy season. Open letters dey call am out, but nothing change. If na heaven, why angels no dey fix the pipes wey leak water? Me sef, as comedian, I dey turn it to joke, because laughter na medicine when hope dey thin.

Now, picture this: Soludo go visit, talk achievements, then back to im state where people still dey complain. Special agent or not, the work no finish. We need action wey make us smile genuine, not just for photo. And in all, remember, even prophets in old times face kings wey no listen, but truth still stand. So, make we keep hoping, praying for leaders wey hear the cry.

Finally, if all this na script for big movie, the hero go fix everything at the end. But in our Naija, the movie dey continue, with us as extras wey dey hustle. So, make una leaders, hear the open letters, win the real wins, and make special mean something for all. Otherwise, we go keep yarning jokes like this one, because if we no laugh, wetin remain?
