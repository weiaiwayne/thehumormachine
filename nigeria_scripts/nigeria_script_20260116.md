My people, picture this scenario wey dey play out for high places, where our leaders dey summon foreign envoys like say dem dey call area boys for owambe party. E be like Trump over there wake up from bad dream, decide to bark about sending troops, and next thing, our oga at the top gathers all those diplomats for Abuja, as if na emergency jollof rice distribution. Wahala for who? Is it the envoys wey come from their countries thinking say dem go sip tea and discuss trade, only to find themselves in one hot room, sweating under AC wey fit turn off any minute? Or the American ambassador, probably wondering if him passport go valid after this wahala. Shey you no see how fast our foreign affairs people move when e concern outsiders? If na internal matter like doctors wey dey strike, e go take months, but for Trump threat, na same day action.

Now, let's yarn about this Bayelsa matter, where the governor there switch sides from PDP to APC, like person wey dey change church because the pastor promise better miracle. E be as if politics na market bargaining, you enter one shop, price no favor, you cross road go another. Brother, if na so, why we no fit switch like that for everyday life? Imagine you dey owe bank loan, you just dump the lender and join another bank wey no ask question. Or your landlord increase rent, you tell am say you don join new estate wey free. No be so e work, abi? But for these politicians, e easy pass swallowing garri without sugar. And the APC people, dem hail am like hero, as if him decision go solve oil spill or flooding wey dey chase people from their homes every rainy season. Me, I dey think, if this switching dey help, make dem switch weather too, so rain no go turn Bayelsa to swimming pool.

Speaking of old soldiers never dying, our president send birthday wishes to General Babangida, the one wey rule back in the day, now clocking 84. E be touching, sha, seeing how former heads dey get shoutout, reminding us say time no dey wait for anybody, even for those wey hold power tight like akara in hot oil. But wait o, while dem dey celebrate longevity, what of the young ones wey no see tomorrow because of one small clinic or road wey no complete? E like say we dey honor past glories, but present struggles dey push us back. And in that same breath, the government dey talk to end doctors' strike, promising to pay salaries wey dey overdue like forgotten debt. Doctors wey suppose save lives, dem dey street because salary no match the wahala of hospital work. Imagine patient wey need operation, but doctor dey picket line, holding signboard instead of scalpel. Na so e be, our health system like old generator wey sputter but never start proper. Yet, in all this, I remember say even when human plans fail, there's that higher power wey heals without bill, the one wey turn water to wine and sickness to testimony. No be by our strength alone, but by grace wey covers every shortfall.

Ah, and don't let me forget this climate change talk from the Lagos governor, Sanwo-Olu, appealing to investors as if na sermon for Davos. Him say make global money come, to fix flooding and heat wey dey roast us like plantain for fire. E sound good, but shey these investors go come with umbrella or AC units? Because for here, rain fall, road turn river, and people dey paddle canoe go market. Or heat wave hit, and everybody dey fan self with newspaper wey carry the same promise. And the irony, Lagos wey dem call most dangerous state, yet e dey attract all this investment talk. Dangerous how? From okada wey zoom like missile, or potholes wey swallow tire, or even the conmen wey smile and collect your ATM pin? But Sanwo-Olu dey push for green energy, solar panels, all that modern jazz. Me, I support am, because if solar work, at least light go stay, no more darkness wey make thief friend. And in that light, e remind me of that verse about being light in darkness, how even small bulb fit chase shadow. Politicians promise power, but true illumination come from above, steady like morning sun.

Now, shift gear to this international drama with Trump again, where our side dey assure say dem handling it diplomatic, no panic. Diplomatic how? By sending more memos or shaking hands over Zoom? Because if Trump serious, him no go tweet threat, him go action am. And us, wey dey watch from afar, eating puff-puff and praying say bullet no fly our way. E be like Nollywood plot, where villain from abroad want colonize again, but hero use sense scatter am. Only this time, no scriptwriter, just real stakes. And while dem dey diplomatize, what of our own internal threats, like youth wey no job, turning to yahoo or worse? Unemployment dey climb like ladder to heaven, but no crown at top. The USA and our government dey talk tackle it, but e remain talk. Imagine if dem summon investors for jobs same way dem summon diplomats for threat. Youth go get work, no more idle hands wey devil use. And faith wise, e be like Joseph story, from prison to palace, showing say breakthrough come after waiting, with patience wey God build.

One more angle, this meeting with World Bank chiefs, where plans dey roll for economy fix. Dem yarn about unrealistic timelines from IMF, say two years too short for our problems. True talk, because our wahala deep like Pacific, from debt wey pile up to food price wey make mama cry at market. But World Bank come, promise loan with strings, and we nod head like obedient child. E be cycle, borrow to pay borrow, round and round like roundabout traffic. And the Igbos for Lagos matter, dem say one Nigeria mirage, like oasis wey disappear when you close. Tension dey brew, projects wey favor one side, making people ask if na national or sectional rule. Is it president for whole or just corner? E pain, because unity suppose be our strength, but division dey feed on small injustice. Yet, in Bible, we see reconciliation stories, like prodigal son return, teaching say forgiveness bridge gap wider than Niger River. If leaders learn that, maybe mirage turn reality.

Finally, this trip to Japan and Brazil, seeking partnership for tech and trade. Sound ambitious, but after all the home front noise, e be like escaping to recharge. Japan with robots, Brazil with carnival vibe, maybe bring back ideas wey fit our hustle. But while oga travel, who mind shop? Flood victims, striking workers, or that teen wey extraordinary but no opportunity? E make you wonder if abroad solution fit local sore. Na so life be, mix of hope and hustle. But at end, even when plans scatter, there's redemption arc wey God write better than any script, turning threat to testimony, strike to settlement, and division to dance. So, my people, let's laugh through the storm, because joy come in morning, and morning dey come, steady.
