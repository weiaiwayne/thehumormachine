Oya, oya, welcome everybody! Welcome to "Chop Life, Chop News," the only news show where we’re reporting from the trenches of Lagos traffic… mentally, at least. How una dey? Good? Good. Because if you’re not good, I’m not sure what you’re doing in Nigeria in the first place!

So, the gist ehn? Na wa for this country. I swear. I was scrolling through Reddit the other day, as you do, trying to find some sanity online, and I stumbled on this story. This guy, Ogbonna Igbojionu, spent 26 years on death row... because he bought a stolen generator! Twenty-six years! For generator! Come on! In a country where NEPA is allergic to electricity, you jail a man for buying a gen? Na wa! It’s like arresting a man for buying water in the Sahara! He’s out now, thank God, but 26 years? That’s enough time to become a PhD holder in generator mechanics!

And then, you see all the "Nigeria is beautiful" posts. Yes, Sade is Nigerian, beautiful woman. No argument there. But let's be honest, sometimes I look around and wonder, "Beautiful *how*?" Maybe the beauty is in our resilience? Because after all the nonsense we face, we still dey smile, still dey hustle. Still dey find joy inside pure water sachet. That's the real Nigerian beauty, abi?

Speaking of hustle, I saw one thread on Nairaland about the new political alliances forming. All these opposition parties, gathering like vultures over… well, you know. They want to “challenge” President Tinubu. Challenge ke? Last time I checked, challenging Tinubu was like trying to push a danfo bus uphill with one hand. Dem dey form alliance, but I still dey see the same old faces, just wearing different agbada.

And the elections? Don’t even get me started. Low female representation again? It’s like they keep forgetting that women are half the population, and the brains of most households. My mama, for example, na she dey run our house. My papa just dey there, dey shout “Respect!” while my mama dey manage the money, the food, and his blood pressure.

And Trump sef, the Yankee Oyibo, just slashed visa stays for Nigerians. Cutting our visas like e dey cut yam. As if it's not hard enough to japa already! "It's a trap!" one person on Reddit shouted. You think? It's always a trap. Dem go collect your visa fees, reject your application, and use the money to build another wall. *Wait, what?* Are we paying for our own oppression now?

This country… chai. One day, I was trying to renew my passport. I went to the passport office, ready for the usual stress. You know, the long queues, the grumpy officials, the smell of generator fumes. And what did I see? A “fast track” lane for public officials! Fast track! For passport! In a country where half the citizens can't even afford to travel abroad. It’s like creating a VIP section in a refugee camp!

That's why, sometimes, I just want to pack my bags and run away to… anywhere that has constant electricity and functioning traffic lights. But then I remember my mama’s jollof rice, my friends, the vibrant energy of Lagos… and I know I can’t leave. Because even with all the wahala, this is still home. Even if home sometimes feels like a badly-run generator repair shop. Remember that guy who spent 26 years in jail for generator issue? That's us! We are all Ogbonna Igbojionu! We are all serving time for the sins of NEPA!

Okay, that's all the news I can handle for today. I need to go and drink something strong, and maybe pray for NEPA to have mercy. But before I go, remember: Chop Life, Chop News, and try not to get arrested for buying a stolen generator! Good night!
