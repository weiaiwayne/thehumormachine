E get this matter wey dey happen for our side wey make me shake head pass the time wey I try catch okada for rush hour. You hear am? This big man from Yankee land, the one wey dress sharp and talk tough, e throw word say e fit send soldiers come scatter things here. Wahala o! And our people up top no waste time, dem call every oyinbo envoy to one big room for the capital, sit dem down, explain say no be so. Diplomatic moves, ehn? Na so e be, but me I dey think, if dem carry that threat serious, who go run first? The ones wey dey promise change or the rest of us wey just wan chop morning rice?

Now, imagine the scene: these diplomats, some with their fancy ties and briefcases, others maybe sipping tea, and our leaders dey lecture dem on peace. E sweet me die. But truth be say, this kind talk no new. Remember how wey back in day, soldiers dey cross borders for small small reason? Now e don turn tweet war. And the response? Our head man say e dey engage, no shaking. Engage how? Through phone call or prayer meeting? Abi na the kind engagement wey end with jollof rice and handshake? Shey you understand? Because if Yankee carry that matter far, na we go feel am for pocket, with price of garri climbing higher pass ladder to heaven.

Speaking of climbing, e get this other twist wey dey make politicians do Olympic somersault. This governor from that oil-rich place, Bayelsa, e just wake up one morning and say bye-bye to his old party, PDP, hello to APC. Defection season don land again! E be like say party loyalty na like old shoe, when e tight, you change am quick quick. And after that, another one from Enugu side go meet the top boss, join the train. Ehn, wetin dey happen? Na contest to see who fit jump ship fastest, or na strategy to chop more national cake? Me I no blame dem, politics na business, and business na survival. But for we wey dey ground, e mean say manifesto yesterday na lie today. Only thing wey no change na the promise of better life, wey still dey wait for tomorrow.

That reminds me of how these moves affect the small man. Take the doctors for example, dem dey strike again, resident ones wey suppose dey save life. Government say dem dey move to end am, but how? With talk or with real money? E pain me sha, because when doctor fold hand, na who go treat malaria wey dey ravage everywhere? And while dem dey negotiate, patients dey queue for pharmacy, buying fake drug from roadside. Na so life be here, wahala on top wahala. But e get one thing wey dey give hope: even for this mess, grace dey flow. You know, the Bible talk say physician heal thyself, but here na government suppose heal the system first. If dem no do am, at least we fit pray say the strike end before next fever attack.

Now, shift gear small, e get this appeal wey come from the Lagos chief executive, Sanwo-Olu, e dey beg global investors to come for climate change talk. Renewed appeal, e call am, on Thursday. Climate change? For where rain dey fall anyhow and flood dey carry people house? E sound good, but me I dey wonder, investors go come when road still dey resemble pothole Olympics? Or when power no steady to run factory? E be like say na fine talk to cover the real issue: we need action, no be just word. And while e dey do that, top man congratulate old military head, Babangida, as e clock 84. Nice gesture, abi? But e make me think, these old soldiers wey turn elders, dem dey advise on peace or just collect birthday cake?

E get this broader picture too, with protest for streets and tussle over traditional stool for north. Emir matter, e no finish. And APC for southwest dey hail neutrality in some state poll. Neutrality? In politics? That one na miracle, bigger pass parting of Red Sea. But e show say even for game of thrones here, sometimes dem play fair. Or so dem claim. Me I no sure, because history full of twist. What I know be say, for we Nigerians, we don learn to laugh through the storm. E be our weapon, better pass stone.

You see, this whole diplomatic summon over Yankee threat, e dey remind me of family meeting when uncle from abroad come visit and start to advise on how to run the compound. Everybody gather, nod head, but nobody change. And the threat? E fade like morning dew. Our leaders engage, and peace hold, at least for now. But if e blow up, na we go dance shakara with empty pocket. So, wetin we do? We pray, we hustle, we joke. Because as the good book say, laughter do good like medicine. And for this country, we need plenty dose.

Another angle: this defection wave, e no just stop at Bayelsa. Enugu governor join too, meet the big oga. E be like musical chairs, but with power seats. Who go sit last? And for what gain? More road for their village or more jet for personal use? We no know, but the pattern clear: when wind change, sail adjust. For ordinary people, e mean policy flip-flop, and we still dey wait for dividend. Dividend wey suppose pay school fee and buy uniform. Shey e no tire you? But e get redemption story here, like prodigal son returning home. Only say the father party dey welcome with open arm and full wallet.

On the doctors strike, government move sweet, but slow. End am quick, make hospital resume. Because life no get standby mode. And for climate appeal, Sanwo-Olu try, but investors need to see result, no be promise. Babangida 84? Happy birthday, sir, your wisdom still needed for this puzzle.

E get this one more thing: top man meet World Bank chiefs, talk development. And reply to IMF say fixing no be two years work. True talk, but how long then? We dey wait. And for Igbos for southwest, dem say unity na illusion. Deep, but e pain. Lagos dangerous? Na so report talk. But we still dey survive, with faith as anchor.

In end, through threat, defection, strike, and appeal, we dey hold on. Politicians play their game, we play ours: laugh, pray, push forward. And if Yankee send soldier? Dem go meet our juju and Jesus combined. No shaking! That na the real defense.
