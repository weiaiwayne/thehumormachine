(Chijioke strides onto the stage, adjusts the mic, and beams at the audience.)

Ah, Nigeria! My people, my people! How una dey? You dey feel the heat? No be only sun o, the political climate dey roast yam head too.

So, President Tinubu, baba is trying, ehn? Trying to juggle the economy, bandits, and opposition parties wey dey form alliance like say na BBNaija strategy. Baba said the economy will improve. We are waiting o. We dey here dey wait like person wey dey queue for fuel for N200 a litre. Remember that time? Ah, those were the days. I even saw one man selling 'exclusive queue jumping services'. Only in Nigeria!

And the Supreme Court, confirming governors left and right. You know how it is. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, sometimes you just wonder what kain law dem dey use. Na Naija law, anything can happen.

Then you see politicians jumping ship. From APC to PDP, PDP to Labour. Dem dey change party like say na Ankara for Owambe. No be principles, na stomach infrastructure! Dem dey follow the soup wey dey sweet pass. You think say dem care about you? O wrong nau!

I saw something on Reddit this week. Someone was asking how to ship a computer to Nigeria. Haba! After all these years, we still dey import everything? Wetin our universities dey teach? Abeg, make dem teach how to manufacture computer, not just how to use am for Yahoo Yahoo.

And the diaspora Nigerians, them get strong opinions o! I saw one TikTok video someone shared. Plenty talk. Easy to talk when you dey Yankee dey chill. Come back home, face Nepa, face road block, face LASTMA, then tell me how you still feel so patriotic.

Speaking of home, my mama called me last week. “Chijioke,” she said, “You don see this new pastor wey dey do miracle with pure water?” I tell you! Nigeria and fake pastors. Na love story wey no dey end. Dem dey multiply like rabbits wey drink Viagra. I told her, “Mama, abeg, focus on your prayers, leave the pure water miracle for Nollywood.” But you know our mamas, dem believe anything wey dem see for church.

Wait, what? I just remembered, I saw a story online, some senator allegedly spent millions on…wait for it…goat meat pepper soup. Goat meat pepper soup! In this economy?! My people, I think I chose the wrong profession. I should have gone into goat farming and opened a pepper soup joint for politicians. I for don buy private jet by now.

Remember the fuel subsidy removal? The government said it would free up funds for infrastructure. I am still waiting to see the express road to my village wey dem promise. Last time I went, the potholes were so big, my car nearly disappeared. E swallow am whole!

But seriously, we have to laugh, abi? If we no laugh, we go cry. Nigeria is like that stubborn child wey you love no matter what. We go complain, we go vex, but at the end of the day, na our own. So, let's raise a glass to Nigeria! May our leaders find sense, may our economy improve, and may Nepa give us light for at least 2 hours a day. Cheers! And abeg, if that senator dey share the pepper soup, make una remember me o!
