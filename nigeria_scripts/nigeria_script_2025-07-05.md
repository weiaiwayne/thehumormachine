Omo, my people, una good evening o! Chijioke Eze, live and direct, reporting from the trenches of Nigerian news. I hope una traffic no too bad today. Lagos traffic ehn, na national embarrassment. Seriously!

So, I been dey browse these Reddit and Nairaland threads today, trying to understand wetin dey really happen for this our Nigeria. And I tell you, my head dey pain me. I see say una still dey argue about politicians, still dey complain about light, still dey look for better jollof. Some things never change, eh?

President Tinubu, the man himself, still dey try to “renew hope.” Renew hope ke? My people, my generator don tire of renewing hope every time NEPA carry light. We dey renew hope more than we dey renew driving license! Dem say him dey work hard on security. I hear. But bandits still dey collect VAT for road wey government supposed dey maintain. Na wa o.

And speaking of things wey government supposed dey do, I see one thread for Reddit about shipping Toyota RAV4 from America to Nigeria. $14,000 for the car, plus shipping! My brother, why you go import car when you fit buy tokunbo for Ikeja? Okay, I know, prestige. But the Customs go finish you! By the time dem finish calculating duty, the RAV4 go cost pass Dangote refinery.

Then I see something about DNA results. One oyinbo man happy say e mostly Nigerian. Oga, welcome! But which tribe you be? Because if you come claim say you Igbo and you no sabi argue about money, we go know say something dey fishy. Seriously, DNA test na one thing, but knowing how to properly spray money at a wedding... that one no dey for DNA!

And Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan... I dey hear say she dey fight for Kogi people. Good for her! We need more strong women for politics. But sometimes, I look at these politicians and I wonder, how many of them actually understand the struggles of the average Nigerian? How many of them don ever enter keke napep for Lagos and nearly have heart attack when the driver start to argue with conductor over change?

I saw one skit online portraying how politicians play tricks on people, and honestly it's sad that it's basically reality.

Speaking of understanding struggles, I remember one time, I was coming from one comedy show for mainland, tired die. Enter bus, and this woman dey sell gala. I don't even like gala like that, but hunger don kill me. I buy one, chop am, nearly choke because e dry. This life no balance at all. And the conductor wan collect extra money because traffic dey bad. Extra money for wetin?! For the suffering wey we dey suffer already? Wait, what?

See ehn, Nigeria na cruise. We complain, we suffer, but we still find way to laugh. We dey argue about jollof rice online, but we go still chop am with our family for Christmas. We dey vex for politicians, but we go still vote for them again next election. Make una no vex o, but sometimes I think say we too sabi forgive.

But seriously, maybe that’s our superpower. We fit forgive, we fit forget, we fit still find joy even when things hard. Na that spirit dey keep us going. But make government no try us too much o, because even Jesus get temper. And when Nigerians vex finish, ehn… Even "renewed hope" no go fit save them! Remember that RAV4 wey dem wan ship? Dem go use am block road for protest!

Abeg, make una share the show with una friends dem. And remember to vote… wisely! Because if we vote anyhow again, na only God fit save us. And even God might say, "Omo, una don try me too much."
