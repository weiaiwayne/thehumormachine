Omo, good evening, my people! Chijioke Eze, live and direct from… well, right here! How una dey? Hope say the NEPA don’t snatch light tonight. Because if them do, ehn, na me and una go fight the BEDC people together.

So, Nigeria, ehn? Always a movie, but this one na Nollywood, the kind wey you buy the DVD for N200 by the roadside. You think say na blockbuster, but after five minutes, you realize say you don waste your money.

The election, dem say na “peaceful transition of power.” Peaceful? My people, I nearly faint when I saw the results. Peaceful for who? Maybe peaceful for the politicians dem, because dem still dey chop belleful. Me? I'm still eating Indomie and egg, waiting for this ‘Renewed Hope’ to reach my side. E dey like Glo network, promise don full ground, signal no dey.

I saw on Reddit someone asking about shipping a RAV4 from the US to Naija. $14,000 for the car? And then you add shipping, customs, ‘owo weekend’ for the officials… before you know it, you’ve spent more than buying a brand new one here! Omo, sometimes I think say importing common pepper from Cotonou is easier than bringing something from America.

Speaking of money, this coalition wey dem form to challenge the ruling party… wetin dem dey challenge exactly? Their pockets don full! Na for TV we dey see them shouting “Accountability!” but behind closed doors, dem dey share the national cake.

And the youth dem? We dey online dey argue about AI-generated content on Reddit. AI! My brother, hunger dey generate real content for my stomach every day! Who AI help? We need AI wey go generate light, generate jobs, generate small change for my pocket.

I saw someone on Nairaland saying they just got their DNA results and they are 'mostly Nigerian'. Wait, WHAT? You mean to tell me you spent money to find out you're Nigerian? Omo, you for just come my street for Lagos. By the time area boys ask you for ‘something for the boys’, your Nigerian-ness go confirm itself sharp sharp!

I remember last year, I went to my village for Christmas. My uncle, the one wey always dey wear agbada wey big pass his house, started giving me lecture on “the importance of voting.” Uncle, last time I checked, you were collecting ‘stomach infrastructure’ from both parties! You dey preach democracy to me, wey dey struggle to pay my PHCN bill?

But seriously, ehn, what's the solution? Someone suggested on Nairaland we need a revolution. Revolution ke? Last time we tried revolution, we ended up with khaki boys and more problems. We just need leaders wey get sense, wey fear God, and wey dey fear the EFCC small.

And maybe, just maybe, one day I go finally chop that 9ja caviar (that is, if I can even afford it). For now, I dey manage my Indomie and egg. The 'Renewed Hope' must renew itself inside my stomach first! But seriously, make una remember to register to vote, and this time, make una vote with your head, not your stomach. Because if we no do am right, next time, I go come here tell una the same joke again! And nobody wan hear that, abi?
