Wetin dey happen for this our country these days ehn, e be like say Hollywood don relocate come Naija and dem dey shoot sequel to every drama wey we don tire to watch. Imagine o, one minute na foreign big man from across the ocean dey talk say e go send soldiers come scatter our peace, and the next minute, our own leaders dey summon ambassadors like say na village meeting for town hall. You sabi dat one wey dem talk say Trump don issue threat of military action? Chai, me I laugh tire. Dis man wey suppose dey busy building walls or tweeting nonsense, now e don turn attention come here, as if e no get enough wahala with e own backyard. And our side? Dem just dey respond say dem dey handle am diplomatically, like say na small quarrel between neighbors wey fit end with bottle of schnapps. But seriously, if Trump fit send army because of wetin, wetin be our own offense? Maybe na because we no pay back dat old loan from World Bank on time, or perhaps na our jollof rice dey make am jealous. No be so? E be like say e see how we dey manage with small small wahala, and e wan come add more pepper to the stew.

Now, let me yarn una small on dis diplomatic summon wey happen for Abuja. All dose foreign envoys gather, looking sharp in dem suits, and our people dey explain say everything dey under control. But ehn, you know how Naija style be – one person go stand up, clear throat, and begin talk big grammar about peace and partnership, while inside mind e dey think say if dis thing turn hot, who go run first? Me I dey imagine dose diplomats sitting down, nodding head, but dem eye dey say, "Oga, una sure say una fit handle dis?" And Trump over there, probably watching on TV, laughing and saying, "See dem dey form James Bond." But wait, on the serious side, e good say our leaders dey engage, because if na to fight, e go be like dat old Nollywood film where everybody dey shout but nobody dey move. Instead, dem choose talk, and dat na wisdom straight from proverbs – better to jaw-jaw than war-war, as Churchill talk, but we go add our own flavor: better to gist-gist than bomb-bomb. And in all dis, e remind me say even when storm dey gather, there is dat quiet faith wey say peace go reign, like how David face Goliath with stone and sling, no need for full army.

Shifting gear small, make I touch on dis Bayelsa matter wey dey make headlines. See dis governor wey suddenly dump PDP join APC, e be like say e wake up one morning, look at mirror, and decide say na time to change jersey mid-match. Wahala o, politics na so e be – today you dey one camp, tomorrow you cross over like say na market woman wey see better price next door. Bayelsa people sef, dem go dey wonder, "Oga, wetin carry you go dat side? Na because of better rice or na the promise of more oil money?" But e no surprise me, because in our system, party loyalty na like gen noise – e dey there, but when fuel scarce, e quiet down sharp sharp. And dose APC people, dem go hail am like hero, saying e wise move, while PDP go cry foul, calling am betrayer. Me I see am as classic Naija survival tactic: when one road block, find another one, even if e mean jumping fence. Imagine if life be so easy – I wake up, see my job no pay well, I just switch company without notice, collect new salary same day. But no, for ordinary citizen, na sweat and hustle, while dose up top dey play musical chairs with power. E sweet pass, abi? Yet, in the midst of dis flip-flopping, e go remind you say true loyalty no dey in parties, but in higher place, where the king wey reign no change sides, and e promise dat every wanderer go find home eventually, like prodigal son story wey end with feast.

Ehn, and speaking on old guards, dis one with Babangida turning 84, and Tinubu sending congratulatory message. Ah, military past don turn birthday bash, with praises flying everywhere. IBB, the man wey step step for power back in the days, now e dey celebrated like elder statesman, complete with cake and claps from afar. But you know, e be like family reunion where everybody pretend say no bad blood, even though history full of coups and dashes. Tinubu yarn say e admire am, probably for surviving so long in dis our rough terrain. Me I dey think, at 84, wetin Babangida dey do now? Sitting down, sipping tea, watching news and shaking head at these young ones wey no sabi how to hold power proper. Or maybe e dey write memoir, spilling small small secrets wey go make us all gasp. "Ah, na so e happen dat time," e go say, and we go read am while dodging potholes on road. But e inspiring sha, to reach dat age still relevant, because in Naija, age no just mean wrinkle, e mean wisdom wey fit school the whole generation. And as dem congratulate am, e make sense say life na marathon, not sprint – run your race, and even if you stumble, grace go carry you cross the line, like how Paul talk in e letters, pressing toward the mark.

Now, let us no forget dis renewed appeal from Sanwo-Olu to global investors over climate change matter. Governor dey call on world to come pour money into Lagos projects, talking about green energy and sustainable this and that. Sound good on paper, but ehn, when you think of our daily grind, e be like promising heaven while ground still dey shake. Investors go listen, nod, maybe sign one paper, but dem go ask, "Oga, how una go make sure dis money no vanish like morning dew?" Because we sabi how funds dey enter and disappear, turning into private jets or mansions abroad. Sanwo-Olu sef, e dey try, appealing for partnership in international forum, but Naija reality na different – rain fall, flood take over streets, and climate change no need invitation, e already dey knock door. Me I dey hope say dis time, e go work, because if investors come with billions, at least e go mean more jobs, less idle hands turning to sharp practices. Imagine o, factory open, people wey dey jobless now go get work, and instead of 419 on phone, dem go dey produce real goods. But wahala be say, even with all dis talk, power still dey flicker like candle in wind, making business hard. Yet, e go be miracle if dis climate push bring real change, reminding us say in the Bible, stewardship of earth na our duty, and when we care proper, blessing go follow like river wey no dry.

And on dat note of strikes, dis move to end resident doctors wahala – government finally stepping in to talk peace with dem. Doctors dey fold arm, patients dey suffer, and now dem dey negotiate like market bargaining. Good sign, because nobody wan die for small small dispute over pay or condition. But e take time sha, like how labor matter always drag, with one side saying una greedy, other side saying una no value us. In the end, if dem settle, e go mean hospitals full again, no more queuing for private clinic wey chop your pocket. Me I pray say e resolve quick, because health no dey wait for politics – one day you fit dey fine, next you need dat doctor sharp sharp. And in all dis tension, e sweet to know say healing no just come from medicine, but from dat divine touch wey make even lame walk, turning crisis to testimony.

Chai, dis our political scene full of twists, from threats abroad to switches at home, birthdays of legends to calls for green cash. But through am all, we dey manage, laughing to keep from crying, holding on to dat hope wey no disappoint. Because if politicians fit flip, we fit adapt, and if world dey watch, we go show dem say Naija spirit no dey break easy. In fact, next time Trump call, tell am say we no need army – we get enough drama here to export. And as for dose investors, come quick, before climate turn our roads to river. Peace!
