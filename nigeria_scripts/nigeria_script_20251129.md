Wahala everywhere, my people, but let's start with this madness wey dey happen up north with our president and these foreign oyibo leaders. You see how Tinubu don call all these ambassadors inside one room for Abuja, like say na town hall meeting for village square? Na over that American big man, Trump, wey open mouth talk say him go send soldiers come scatter our peace if we no behave. E be like say dem dey play football match, but instead of ball, na our whole country dem dey kick up and down. And Tinubu, sharp guy, him no waste time, summon dem all, tell dem say we no dey fear, we get our own plan. But me sef, I dey wonder, wetin next? Dem go serve jollof rice and pepper soup to cool temper, or na bushmeat dem go chop while dem negotiate? Because if na true war dem wan start, e better make dem first fix our roads before dem march with boots.

That one don make me think about how our leaders always dey act like superheroes in Nollywood movie, saving the day with big grammar and handshakes. Remember that time Babangida, the old general wey rule before, just clock 84 years? Tinubu send him birthday wishes, full of respect, calling am elder statesman. E sweet, abi? But wait, this same Babangida na the man wey drop coup that year, scatter everything, now him dey collect cake like innocent grandpa. Life na circle, shey you see? One day you dey hold power with iron fist, next day you dey thank God for long life and good health. Me, I dey pray say my own birthday go come with such VIP messages, not just "happy birthday" from mama for kitchen. And in all this, e remind me of that Bible story where Saul turn Paul, from persecutor to preacher—maybe our politicians too get their redemption arc, turning from coup plotters to birthday boys. Grace dey work overtime for Naija.

Now, shift gear small to this Bayelsa matter, where the governor there, Douye Diri, dump PDP like bad habit and run go join APC. E be like say PDP na old girlfriend wey tire person, full of drama but no future, so him jump fence go the other side wey promise better things. Politics for Naija na like market bargaining, one minute you dey haggle for tomatoes, next you change stall if the price no favor you. And APC dey hail am, open arms wide like prodigal son don return. But question now: wetin this switch go bring? More oil money for Bayelsa, or just another layer of wahala with pipeline vandals and community fights? Because down south, we know say oil na blessing and curse mixed together, like that stew wey sweet but dey pepper mouth too much. I dey laugh because if politicians fit switch parties like we switch SIM cards when credit finish, maybe we ordinary people sef go start dey switch jobs every month for better salary. Imagine CV wey get ten parties listed under experience—dem go employ am sharp!

Speaking of switches, let's talk this oil industry plan wey the minister just unveil, promising to turn everything around like magic wand. Him talk say dem go build refineries, fix supply chains, make Nigeria export crude like no tomorrow. Sound good, right? But e be like those new year resolutions wey we shout with full chest on December 31, come January 2, e don fade. Minister dey paint picture of booming economy, jobs for youth, no more importation wahala. Yet, we still dey queue for black market when official channels fail. And now, dem even do U-turn on that 15 percent tariff for fuel imports—first dem impose am to protect local, next dem cancel say e too harsh. Flip-flop like politician's promise during rainy season. Me sef, as Lagos boy, I know say transformation no come easy; e take sweat, prayer, and maybe small miracle from above. Like how David face Goliath with sling and stone—our oil giants need that same faith to slay the foreign dependency dragon. Without am, na just talk we go hear, echoing in empty barrels.

But hold on, this neutrality talk from Lagos APC about Anambra election don catch my eye too. Dem praise Tinubu say him no take side, stay neutral like referee in football match. Good one, because if na rigging dem suspect, better make federal hand clean. Anambra na Igbo heartland, full of sharp businessmen and women wey no dey play with politics. If Tinubu fit balance there without bias, e go earn respect from all corners. But truth be say, neutrality in Naija politics na rare commodity, like pure water for dry season. Most times, e be camouflage for deeper game. And we, the masses, we dey watch like fans in stadium, shouting goals or penalties depending on who score. E make me remember that scripture about being wise as serpent but harmless as dove—politicians need that mix to survive. Otherwise, na hot seat dem go siddon.

Now, imagine all these global handshakes and party jumps mixing with our daily grind. You dey rush for danfo in morning traffic, dodging potholes like landmines, then radio burst with news of Trump threat and diplomat meetings. E be like say world wahala don enter your commute uninvited. And when NEPA decide to take light just as you wan charge phone for updates, e sweet pass anything—total blackout on politics and power. But even in that darkness, we Nigerians get generator spirit, or we light candle and gist till morning. Family dynamics too dey play role; papa go say "trust no oyibo," mama go add "pray make God intervene," and siblings dey argue who go fetch fuel if scarcity hit again. Cultural traditions hold us: we go still do owambe for celebrations, no matter the headlines.

That one lead me to World Bank chiefs meeting Tinubu in Abuja—dem come with loans and advice, like uncles visiting with pocket money but strings attached. Him listen, nod, promise reforms, but we know say fixing Naija problems no be two years work, as IMF sef admit. E unrealistic, like expecting Lagos to stop being chaotic overnight. Unemployment still dey bite hard; youth dey hustle side gigs, from Okada to online scams—not the 419 kind, but legit tech. And Igbos in Lagos shouting one Nigeria na mirage? Deep talk, but e show say unity na work in progress, like building that third mainland bridge extension. Sanwo-Olu talk coexistence as challenge—true, Lagos na pot where all tribes dey boil together, sometimes overflow.

Even with all this, hope dey. Like that extraordinary Nigerian teen wey dey make waves online, proving say from ashes, talent rise. Or the drummer confessing his life beats—rhythm in chaos. Ranking our foods? Jollof still number one, no debate. And NNPC talking naira deals with refineries? Step forward, if e no reverse tomorrow.

But here's the real punch: if politicians fit learn from Babangida's long life, stay neutral like in Anambra, and transform oil without U-turns, maybe Naija go shine like promised land. Until then, we go laugh through the storm, because only Jesus fit deliver eternal power—no outage, no tariff. Amen to that, and goodnight!
