Wetin dey happen for this our country sef, e be like say our leaders don turn professional dancers, always switching steps mid-performance without missing a beat. Take that matter wey happen for Bayelsa, where the big oga there decide to jump ship from one party to another, like say na market bargaining we dey talk. One minute PDP, next thing APC, e sweet am well well. I dey wonder, if politicians fit change color like chameleon so fast, why una no use that talent for creating jobs or fixing roads? Abi, shey na only for election season dem remember say loyalty na optional extra? E get one time I watch football match, player change jersey midway, referee go red card am sharp sharp, but here, dem hail am as hero. Na wa o, if life na football, our leaders go win Ballon d'Or for inconsistency.

Now, picture this wahala with that American big man, Trump, wey open mouth talk say e fit send soldiers our way, as if we dey owe am money or something. Our side no waste time, summon every diplomat for Abuja, like say na emergency family meeting. I mean, wetin Trump think say Nigeria be, some small village wey e fit bully? We get history of warriors from ancient times, from Oduduwa to those Benin bronze masters, e no easy to shake us. But see the response, our oga assure say dem dey handle am with diplomacy, no shaking. E remind me of those Nollywood films where the hero talk big but use sense to win, no need for gun. And me sef, I dey pray say peace go reign, cos as Bible talk for Proverbs, "A soft answer turns away wrath," abi? If una use sweet words finish, maybe Trump go change mind, turn am to trade deal instead of threat. But honestly, if e reach that level, I go dust my passport and run go village, tell mama say "No be juju, na oyinbo wahala."

That other gist sef, where dem hail neutrality for Anambra matter, e funny pass. Dem say the top man stay neutral, no pick side, like referee wey no wan blow whistle. But wait o, in this our setup, neutrality mean say you dey watch from fence, collecting from both ends maybe. I remember when I small, my uncle always neutral for family arguments, end up eating jollof from two plates. Shey na the same script? E be like say for politics, staying neutral na strategy to avoid wahala, but e no solve the real problem wey dey ground. People dey suffer, queues for rice and garri longer than harmattan breeze, yet dem dey pat back for not choosing team. If I neutral for hunger, I go still dey hungry, no be so? Na why I like that verse for James, wey talk say faith without works na dead. Neutrality fine, but action wey bring change na the real blessing.

Ehn, and talk of that U-turn on the 15 percent tariff for fuel import, dem announce am one day, next day reverse am like say na joke. Wetin be this, policy as trial and error? I dey think say if dem apply that for everyday life, e go mad. Like, charge me 15 percent extra for okada ride today, tomorrow say "Oya, forget am, free ride." Who no go hail? But seriously, e show say listening to people voice matter, even if e late small. Reminds me of those market women wey haggle price till seller fold, victory for small man. Yet, the struggle still dey, prices dey climb like monkey for iroko tree, and families dey manage with one meal sef. I get neighbor wey wake up 5am to hustle for daily bread, only to hear policy flip-flop. Na God grace dey carry person, cos as e talk for Matthew, "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself." E help me stay hopeful, even when economy dey do press-up.

Then, the talk with those World Bank chiefs for Abuja, e sound like high-level date, discussing how to tackle joblessness. Dem siddon, yarn about plans, but me I dey ask, when go the youth chop? We get plenty graduates wey hold degree like trophy, yet dem dey dash CV for street corner. E be like say education na ticket to waiting room, no VIP access. I know one boy from my area, sharp brain, but now e dey drive keke, praying for breakthrough. And that IMF advice wey dem reply say unrealistic to fix everything in two years, e true sha. Rome no build in one day, but e get limit to how long person go wait. If two years na joke, wetin be 10 years? Politicians dey promise heaven on earth, but only the Almighty one deliver true prosperity. E dey make me laugh, cos Nigerians resilient, turn scarcity to ingenuity, like turning plantain to dodo masterpiece.

See this one too, where the top man congratulate that old general Babangida on hitting 84. E sweet, showing respect for elders, but e pull my leg small. Man don see plenty seasons, from military days to now, still sharp. If I reach that age, I wan dey tell stories wey inspire, no be ones wey cause headache. But e get lesson there, longevity come with wisdom, and Bible say for Psalms, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." So maybe if our leaders tap that, instead of threats and switches, we go move forward. Yet, while dem celebrate birthdays, the rest of us dey dodge potholes and queue for ATM. Na the Nigerian condition, mix of joy and jara.

And that matter of extending deal between NNPC and that refinery mogul for crude supply in naira, e promising. No more dollar wahala, keep money inside. But I dey watch, cos promises plenty, delivery na the test. Like when pastor talk revival, you wait see if church full next Sunday. E go help economy breathe small, reduce that pressure on wallet. I think of my sister wey save every kobo for school fees, if this work, e go ease her load. Grace dey work in mysterious ways, turning deals to blessings.

Now, on the doctors strike wey dem move to end, thank God o. Resident doctors fold arms, hospitals empty, people dey suffer. But see, negotiation don start, peace loading. E show say voice loud enough go hear. In my village, if rain no fall, everybody gather pray and plan, same here. No be small thing, health na wealth, and as e say for 3 John, "I pray that you may enjoy good health." If doctors back, e mean hope for sick ones. But funny part, while dem strike, some go herbalist, mix agbo with faith, survive by miracle. Na our way, blend modern and traditional.

That Igbos for Lagos talk, wey some say one country na illusion, e heavy. But me, I believe unity na choice, no be force. We get different tongues, but same hustle spirit. Like in that Sanwo-olu yarn about challenged coexistence, e true, but we go overcome. And those lopsided projects question, shey the top man na for whole or one spot? E make sense to ask, cos development suppose spread like gospel. If e concentrate one place, others feel neglected, like prodigal son story, but without the welcome back.

Even that ranking of foods, e dey show our diversity, from pounded yam to suya, each region claim best. But wahala be say, with prices, ranking no fill belly. And the drummer confession, e inspire, turning beat to living. Nigerians creative, no dull moment.

As for heading to Japan and Brazil, e good for connections, bring investment. But while away, who mind the home front? E like leaving party to fetch more drinks, hope no thief enter. And that dangerous state talk for Lagos, e over, but traffic and touts na real, yet we navigate with prayer.

In end, through all this mix-up, na faith keep us standing. Politicians dance, threats fly, policies flip, but the One above steady. So, next time wahala knock, remember, even in storm, rainbow dey wait. And if Trump call, tell am say Nigeria no dey shake, we dey vibe with grace.
