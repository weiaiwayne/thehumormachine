(Chijioke walks on stage, adjusting the mic. The crowd in the imagined Lagos bar roars a welcome.)

Ah, Naija! My people, my people! How una dey? Hope say NEPA give una light today? Abi una generator don dey sing baritone since morning?

So, I just come back from obodo oyinbo, right? Small holiday. You know, recharge the batteries before I return to the madness we call Nigerian politics. And omo, I land back in Lagos and it's like I never left. Same wahala, different day.

First thing I see on Reddit: "Buhari is dead, Rest in Piss." Haba! Nigerians ehn, we no dey forgive! Even in death, dem still dey drag Baba. But seriously, the poverty rate under that regime… e shock me. Like, we just accepted suffering as a national sport.

Then I see on Nairaland, everybody still arguing about Tinubu. Some saying he’s the best thing since jollof rice, others saying he’s the reason garri is now luxury. Bros, which one is the truth? Because me, I just want light, good roads, and make my salary reach end of month. Is that too much to ask?

Speaking of Tinubu… dem say he’s using federal power to pressure opposition governors to join APC. Wait, what? Is this even legal? I thought we were supposed to be a democracy, not a one-party state masquerading as a bowl of eba. Last last, everyone will decamp. Politics in Nigeria is just musical chairs with briefcases.

And women? Haaa! See, that’s one thing that pains me. The 2023 elections, low female representation in federal legislative seats. We talking about 2025, and women still struggling to get a seat at the table. Mama is cooking the food, Mama is cleaning the house, Mama is even paying some of the bills, but Mama can’t make law? E no make sense, abeg.

Remember that time my aunty wanted to run for local government chairman? She get all the qualifications, she get the experience, she get the support of the community. But when election time came, thugs chased her away from the polling unit. Thugs! This is why we can't have nice things. This is why corruption will continue to chop our money and use toothpick to select teeth.

And Boko Haram? Dem still dey disturb peaceful Nigerians for North East. Every year, na the same story. Government promise to “crush” them. Bros, how many times we go crush these people? Dem be cockroaches? You crush one, ten more spring up.

But make we no lie, Nigerians are resilient. We go find a way to laugh even in the midst of the suffering. I see one post on Nairaland jokes section. Hmmm, the people dem funny sha.

Anyway, the Reddit discussion on AI-generated content… I laugh. We can’t even handle real content, now we want to worry about AI? Before we start worrying about AI stealing our jobs, let us first worry about politicians stealing our money. Abi no be so?

(Chijioke pauses for applause, wipes his brow.)

But seriously, Wole Soyinka turned 91! Baba still dey strong, still dey vex for government. Legend! But e pain me sha. You know, you wan look at the next generation of leaders, but then you see the headlines: "Out with the old and in with the… older?" Aiyya! Are we just recycling politicians until they turn to dust? Make we give youths chance now!

So, I land back in Lagos and nothing has changed. Coalition dey, tensions dey, corruption dey, the price of fuel dey… But you know what? We go survive. We go find joy in the small things. We go laugh at the madness and keep pushing. Because that’s what Nigerians do. We are the champions of surviving!

(Chijioke bows as the imagined crowd cheers wildly.)
