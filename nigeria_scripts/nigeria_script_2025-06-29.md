Ah, Naija! Good evening, my people! How una dey? You’re looking good, Lagos! Even with the fuel price, you still manage to shine. That’s the Naija spirit, ehn? We dey hustle, we dey smile, we dey somehow survive!

So, I was online the other day, checking out r/Nigeria. Una dey vex, ehn? Plenty complaints about the new moderator. Ah, Nigerians and change! We love to complain about the old, then complain even louder about the new. It’s like our national anthem.

And Nairaland? My people, una no dey sleep! Always dissecting every politician’s sneeze, every minister’s haircut. I swear, some of una are better detectives than the EFCC! Speaking of the EFCC, remember that guy who swallowed millions of Naira? Ehn, that one is a movie plot waiting to happen. I heard Netflix is already interested. They want to call it "The Billion Naira Bloat."

But seriously, the way money just dey disappear in this country… It’s like a magic trick, but instead of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, they pull out an empty bank account. Wait, what? Did I just make sense of Nigerian politics?

Tinubu, our Baba Himself, is trying, ehn? He’s reforming things left and right. Petrol subsidy gone, exchange rate floating… My wallet is also floating, floating straight down to the bottom of the sea. But hey, at least he’s trying. Trying to make sense of the madness that is Nigeria. It’s like trying to herd cats during a harmattan.

Remember that doctor, the Nigerian doctor in America who won all eight awards? We’re exporting brains while importing… well, let's just say we're good at importing challenges. We need to find a way to keep our best and brightest here. Maybe we should start giving awards for “Most Patient Nigerian” or “Most Creative Hustler.” We’d break Guinness records!

But the real question I have is this: all this talk about reforms and progress, when will NEPA give us steady light? I'm not asking for 24/7, I’m just asking for enough time to charge my phone and watch one full episode of BBNaija in peace! Is that too much to ask?

I remember when I was a kid, we used to call NEPA “Never Expect Power Always.” Now, I think it’s more like “Now Expect Power… After you pay the bribe.” Small yawa, they cut your light. Even if you’re using solar! They will come and disconnect your sun! Naija, I tell you!

But at the end of the day, we still love our country. We complain, we argue, we fight over politics on social media, but we are still Nigerians. We still find a way to laugh, to dance, to celebrate even when things are hard. Like my friend who lost his job because of the new government policy, he still threw a small party. I asked him why and he said, "Chijioke, I need to celebrate the end of my suffering!"

(Chijioke pauses, grins again)

And that, my friends, is the Naija spirit. We dey laugh even when we wan cry. And we dey hope, even when there’s no hope. Because, at the end of the day, we know say Naija go survive. We just need to survive Naija first. Remember when I said my wallet is floating? Well, it’s now officially a submarine. Good night, Lagos!
