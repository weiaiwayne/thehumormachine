Ah, Naija! My people, how una dey? You know, sometimes I just siddon dey think, is this country playing a prank on us? Because, honestly, the joke don dey drag too long.

I was reading the Reddit threads today, and one guy was shouting, "Leave the Northerners alone!" And I'm thinking, bros, who's even touching them? Everybody just dey manage their own wahala these days. Even our politicians are too busy sharing the national cake to remember tribalism. Sharing cake, and leaving crumbs for us – crumbs we still dey fight over!

Speaking of politicians, ehn, this new coalition… They say they want to "rescue Nigeria." Rescue us from who? Themselves! It's like the thief shouting "Ole!" to distract you while he's still running with your phone. We've seen these faces before, just recycling themselves like agbado in a microwave. Round and round and round.

Remember that INEC deregistration of 74 parties in 2021? 74! Ah, Nigeria! It's like saying you have 74 girlfriends, but none of them get recharge card. What's the point? All those parties, all those manifestos... Na paper wey dem use chop suya later.

And then, I saw something on Reddit about North Carolina declaring "Igbo Day." Igbo Day in America! Meanwhile, back home, we're still arguing about who owns Lagos. Ha! This life no balance at all. Our people are celebrating our culture on foreign soil, while we are busy fighting over land that belongs to all of us. Wait, what? Igbo Day in North Carolina? I need to book a flight. Maybe I fit get honorary citizenship.

You know, last week, I went to renew my driver's license. Small thing, you go think say na rocket science. The queue was longer than Third Mainland Bridge on a Monday morning. And the officer, bless his heart, was typing with one finger. One. Finger. Like he was writing the Nigerian constitution all over again. After three hours, he looks at me and says, "Oga, network is bad." Network! In this age of 5G! It's like using a snail to deliver a WhatsApp message. I just laughed. What else can you do? You can't vex. Na Naija we dey.

But the real kain wahala is how women are being represented less and less in government. It's like saying the soup is ready, but you are only serving the men. Where's the pepper for the women? We need pepper, ehn! We need to spice up these political palates.

Anyway, I saw one joke on Nairaland the other day, about a politician who promised to bring NEPA to every house. And someone commented, "He should start with his own first!" I almost choked on my pepper soup. That's the kind of savage we need in this country. Straight to the point, no sugarcoating.

So, what's the solution? I don't know o! If I knew, I for don become president. But one thing I know: we need to laugh, otherwise, we will cry. And crying, my people, will not solve anything. Unless you're crying for money. Then, maybe, just maybe, a good Samaritan will hear your plea. But don't hold your breath. Remember that coalition I mentioned earlier? Maybe… just maybe... Nah, who am I kidding? They're just recycling agbado!

I think I need another bottle of Star. Who's buying? Because, honestly, after all this talk, I'm feeling like I need to "rescue myself" from this conversation. *chuckles*
