Eh, my people, imagine waking up one morning to hear say some big man from across the Atlantic dey issue threats like him dey cast spell for Nollywood film. President Trump, that one wey sabi talk plenty, go on and announce say him fit send troops come our side if things no straighten up. Wetin? Military action for Naija? As if we no get enough wahala with our own soldiers wey dey do parade every Independence Day. But wait o, our own President Tinubu no waste time, him summon all those diplomats for Abuja, like say na emergency meeting for village square. Him talk say dem dey handle am diplomatically, assuring everybody say no be fight we want. Diplomatic, abi? Shey na the same way dem dey negotiate for market when price of yam don scatter? I dey tell you, if Trump hear say we go respond with jollof diplomacy, him go think twice.

But seriously, this whole matter dey show how the world dey eye us now. One side, dem dey talk military, other side, our leaders dey pat each other back for staying neutral in some state polls. Take that Anambra thing, for example. The APC boys for that area dey hail Tinubu say him no take side, like say neutrality na new Olympic sport. Neutrality ke? In this our politics wey everybody dey switch alliance faster than Okada rider dey dodge pothole? I remember when dem used to say politics na dirty game, but now e be like chess wey pawns dey promote to king every weekend. And Tinubu, God bless am, him dey respond to all this by congratulating old generals on their birthdays. Babangida don clock 84, and President send him warm wishes, like say na family reunion. IBB, the one wey used to rule with iron fist, now dey collect birthday shoutout. E sweet, but e make me wonder: if na so dem dey celebrate, when go dem congratulate we the common people for surviving another year of this economy?

Speaking of celebrations, let us yarn about that Bayelsa matter. The governor there, Douye Diri, decide to jump ship from PDP to APC, like say him dey change airline mid-flight without parachute. One day dem dey opposition, next day dem dey ruling party. Wetin happen? Bribe? Promise of better portfolio? Or just say the grass look greener on the other side? In Naija politics, party switching na like changing church denomination when pastor promise miracle money. You go from shouting hallelujah for one side to amen for the other, but the offering plate still empty. And the people? Dem just dey watch, shaking head, because at the end, na the same wahala: roads wey no motorable, hospitals wey no medicine. But e good to see say even in the creeks, dem sabi play the game. Maybe next time, governors go switch parties based on who dey win EuroMillions.

Now, shift gear small to health side, because even with all this political drama, life no dey stop. Our resident doctors don strike again, and government dey move to end am. Strike? Again? As if na annual festival. These doctors, God go bless dem, dem dey fight for better pay, but meanwhile, patients dey queue for pharmacy like say na Black Friday sale for tomatoes. Government promise to talk, but e be like dem dey use the same script from last year. Wey the urgency? If na politician sick, hospital go turn five-star hotel overnight, but for ordinary man, na prayer warrior mode activate. I dey think, maybe if dem add some biblical incentive, like say strike end with manna from heaven, doctors go resume sharp-sharp. Because in this country, the only thing wey no dey strike na the sun, wey dey beat person head every afternoon.

But let us not forget the big picture with all this international wahala. Tinubu dey meet World Bank chiefs, talking investment, while on ground, unemployment dey chase youth like dog dey pursue cat. Wey the jobs? Dem talk say USA and Naija dey team up to tackle am, but so far, na only call center jobs wey pay peanut. And IMF? Dem come with advice say fix everything in two years, but Tinubu government fire back say e unrealistic. Of course e unrealistic! Wey the magic wand? In Naija, problem no dey solve in two years; e dey take two decades, and even then, half-done. Like that time when dem promise free education, but now WAEC fee don turn budget for wedding. E pain, but e make sense to laugh, because if you no laugh, you go cry, and tear no dey pay bill.

Now, yarn about that refinery deal. NNPC and Dangote dey talk to extend crude supply with naira, no more dollar wahala. Sound good, right? Finally, something wey go ease the scarcity. But wait, e be like dem dey negotiate in secret, like cult meeting. If e work, fuel price go drop? Or na just another promise wey go evaporate like morning dew? I dey hope say na the real deal, because last time dem talk refinery, we still dey import petrol like say we no get oil well for backyard. And the investors? Sanwo-Olu dey appeal to global people for climate change summit, talking Lagos as investment hub. Climate change in Lagos? With all the flood every rainy season? E be like inviting people to party in swimming pool without life jacket. But kudos to am, at least him dey try rebrand the chaos into opportunity. Maybe next, dem go sell flood water as new energy drink.

Eh, and that Igbos in Lagos talk, where some say one Nigeria na illusion. Deep o, but in comedy, we no dey deep-dive; we dey surface-skim with smile. Because truth be say, we all dey same boat, paddling through storm, and if boat sink, na everybody go swim. Wey the division help? Politicians dey use am to divide and rule, but we the masses, we dey intermarry, share food, hustle together. Like that market woman wey sell to Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa same day, no time for tribal dance. And the projects? Some dey complain say Tinubu dey favor one area, like say presidency na state governor extension. But e no new; every leader get him people. The key na to pray say the grace wey hold Naija together no expire, because without am, na pandemonium.

Finally, as we wrap this political soap opera, remember say even in all this noise, there dey a higher power wey no dey switch sides. Politicians promise paradise on earth, but only the good book deliver real hope. So, when Trump threaten or governor jump, just hold your peace, because the one wey calm the storm no dey do threat; Him dey do miracles. And if Naija survive this, e go be testimony wey go make heaven jealous. Stay blessed, my people.
