Eh, my good audience, wetin dey happen for this our country sef? I dey look dis matter of Senate President Godswill Akpabio and how im actions dey scatter everywhere like confetti for wedding wey no fine. You see am? One day e dey sign bills, next day e dey inside one wahala wey make headlines jump up pass frog for hot water. Na so e be, abi? Politicians for Naija, dem no dey tire to give us fresh drama, shey you understand? Like say dem get script from Nollywood but forget to add di happy ending.

Now, let me yarn una small on dis energy investment wey dem talk say Naija don secure eight billion dollars. Eight billion! Chai, dat na money wey fit build mansion for every family for village, or even buy generator wey no go cough every five minutes. But wait o, who dey benefit from dis big money? Na di big boys wey dey wear agbada like kings, or na we wey dey hustle for street? I remember one time, my uncle for village hear say government dey bring light to everywhere, e rush go buy candle finish, only for NEPA to still take di light go vacation. Na so e be, eight billion dey come, but di ordinary man still dey grope for darkness. And di funny part? Dem say na for energy, but my phone charger still dey beg for mercy every night. Shey na joke?

Speaking of big deals, hear dis one: our NNPC and dat Dangote refinery don enter talk to extend supply of crude oil using naira. Naira o! Not dollar, not euro, pure our own currency. E sound like smart move, ehn? Like say finally, we wan keep di money inside house instead of sending am abroad to chop jollof. But hold on, wetin go happen when di price of dat crude start to climb? Dem go tell us say na global wahala, but deep down, na di same old story. I imagine Dangote sitting down for im office, counting naira notes like confetti, while we for market dey haggle over tomatoes wey cost pass gold. And di refinery? E go refine oil, but e no fit refine di suffering wey dey follow. Na so life dey, one hand dey give, di other dey collect back with interest. But e get one thing wey no dey change: even when di economy dey shake like earthquake, di grace of God dey steady am like rock. You sabi dat Bible talk say di Lord na our refuge, no be refinery.

Ah, now let me shift to dis social housing matter wey dey make me laugh inside. Dem ask if any government ever build proper housing for di masses, and wetin remain today. Kai, na question wey fit make pastor turn comedian. Back in di days, dem promise estate for everybody, like say na heaven on earth. But today? Na ghost towns, buildings wey roof don fly away, or walls wey crack pass dry harmattan skin. I go visit one such place for outskirts, e look like film set for zombie movie, but no actor, just weed growing tall pass human. And di politicians? Dem dey inside im own mansion wey get swimming pool and gym, while we dey pray for roof wey no leak when rain fall. E funny how dem remember poor man only during campaign season, den after, na "see you next four years." Shey una see? But e sweet me say for all dis mess, we still get hope. Like dat verse wey talk say God go wipe every tear, even di one from leaking roof. Na im dey keep us going, no be di promise wey dem no fulfill.

And oya, make I touch dis iPhone 8 price for Naija market. Person go ask how much e dey go now, and di answer go make you weak. Chai, dat old phone wey abroad dem don forget, here e still dey cost arm and leg, like say na di latest iPhone 50. Why? Because import duty dey chop di money, and black market dey add im own spice. I see one guy for bus stop, e dey show off im iPhone 8 like trophy, but e battery dey die faster pass politician promise. E tell me say e buy am second hand, but di price na almost half million naira. Half million! For phone wey screen crack easy pass egg. Na so our economy dey play us, turning small small gadget to big big burden. Meanwhile, di rich ones dey upgrade to iPhone whatever, while we dey manage Nokia 3310 wey still dey work after apocalypse. But laugh small, because even if phone no work, prayer line no dey disconnect. You fit call on high anytime, and e always answer, no network wahala.

Now, dis matter of helping Nigerian Christians, e touch my heart small. Person dey ask how to assist, and na true question for time like dis. You see, for Naija, faith no be side thing, na di main course. But wahala plenty: persecution here, poverty there, yet churches full every Sunday, singing like no tomorrow. I think say di best help na to join di fight, share di load, maybe send small support or even come visit. But e funny how outsiders dey wonder, while we inside dey manage with smile. Like one time, my pastor say "brethren, even when devil dey plot, God dey laugh last." Na so e be, help come in many ways, but di real power na from above, no be from any NGO. And for di tourists wey wan travel from one place to another without flying, like dat question on how to go from capital to northern city, ehn, na adventure waiting. Bus wey go take days, potholes wey fit swallow car, but at di end, you go reach with story wey fit fill book. No fly? Na luxury for some, but for us, road trip na di norm, complete with sing-along and prayer for safe journey.

Extraordinary teens from Lagos, or dat kid wey dey amaze everybody, na di future wey dey shine bright. You hear of dem doing things wey adult no fit imagine, like inventing app or winning global prize. But wait o, wetin di system do to keep dem going? Na struggle, from school fees to opportunity. Yet, dem no give up, pushing like say tomorrow na today. And di crazy things happening? From one scandal to another, like say Naija na reality TV show wey no get script. Funny but true, e dey happen everywhere, making us shake head but still laugh. Even in di midst of it, we remember say redemption dey possible, grace abundant like rain for rainy season.

One more gist: dat alleged lopsided projects, where dem say leader dey favor one area over di whole country. E spark talk say na im home state dey chop all, like say di rest no exist. Na old song, but e play on repeat. Imagine building bridge where no river, or road wey lead to nowhere, just to show say "I did something." But di masses? Dem still dey cross river with canoe wey leak. Sarcastic, ehn? But true. And di coexistence challenge, how we dey live together but tension full ground. Na delicate dance, stepping on toes but still moving. Yet, for all dis, faith teach us forgiveness, turning enemy to brother, like prodigal son story. No be easy, but na di way.

President traveling abroad again, to Japan and Brazil, shaking hands and signing deals. E good, but when e come back, wetin change for street? Same hustle, same queue for rice. And di reply to international body say fixing problems no fit happen in two years, na realistic talk, but we don hear am before. Unrealistic? Maybe, but hope no dey tire. Finally, on dat drummer confession or ranking foods, e remind me say even in wahala, we still find joy in small things: beat of drum or plate of pounded yam. Na so we survive, laughing through di storm, knowing say one day, di sun go shine proper.

Eh, my people, if life na comedy, Naija na di best stage, full of twists wey make you cry and laugh same time. But remember, di Director up there get di best plot, and e no dey disappoint. Stay strong, keep faith, and who knows, maybe next time, di joke go on dem.
