Eh, my brothers and sisters, imagine dis one: our oga for up dey receive visitors from di state, and e no be small small visit o. Na full parade, like say dem dey plan how to fix di wahala wey dey ground us every day. Soludo roll in, shaking hands, smiling dat smile wey say "we go sort am," but me I dey wonder, after all di talk-talk, wetin go change for di common man wey dey hustle for survival? You know dat feeling when you dey wait for light, NEPA don take am go vacation, and your generator just dey cough like e catch cold from di rain. Dat na di real story, abi? But dem up dia, dem dey yarn achievement, like say building roads go suddenly make jobs appear from heaven. Hah, if only e simple like dat.

Now, let me paint dis picture for una. You dey stand for bus stop, danfo driver dey hoot like madman, traffic jam long pass queue for rice subsidy. And somewhere for di big house, dem dey write open letters, pouring out heart like say na love note to sweetheart. "Oga, please do something," dem beg, but e be like di words just dey bounce off di wall, enter one ear, fly out di other. Me I laugh, because if letter fit solve unemployment, why we no dey flood di post office every morning? Compare am to how di Americans dey handle dia own matter, dem get plans, training, even apps wey connect you to work. Here? Na prayer and hope, and sometimes dat hope feel like e dey wear out faster dan your old slippers. But wait, e get one thing wey dey sweet me: even when di economy dey shake like earthquake, di grace wey come from above no dey shake. E steady, e strong, reminding us say better days no be dream, but promise wey go come true.

Shift gear small, talk about dis by-election matter wey dem dey celebrate like won lottery. Massive win, dem shout, endorsement for di whole setup. But shey una see am? E be like dat uncle wey go wedding, eat all di food, drink all di drinks, den claim say na him organize di whole thing. Victory sweet, no doubt, but for who? For di man wey dey trek miles to find daily bread, or for di ones wey dey count votes like na beads for rosary? I dey think, if dis win mean more work for youth, more clinics wey no dey empty, more schools wey teach real skills, den e go worth am. Otherwise, na just noise, echoing empty for di market square. And talking market, you go dia to buy yam, seller go add price, say "things hard," but up dia, dem dey yarn special qualities, like say one man fit wave magic wand fix everything. Hah, if e true, why my pocket still dey cry every time I check am?

Let me gist una about dis corruption talk wey dey fly around like kite for harmattan. Dem call am heaven, but me I see am as dat neighbor wey borrow your tool, never return am, den act like nothing happen. Agents from abroad, CIA whispers, all dat conspiracy yarn wey make you pause and think. Is e true say foreign hands dey pull strings? Or na just excuse for why things no dey move forward? Picture dis: you dey church, pastor dey preach redemption, say confess your sins, make amends, and grace go cover you. But for politics, e be like dem confess for camera, promise change, den next day, same old dance. Wahala everywhere, but di beauty na say faith teach us patience, teach us to hold on, because even when leaders falter, di one wey sit high no dey sleep. E dey watch, e dey work behind scenes, turning mess into testimony.

Now, imagine di absurdity: Soludo visit, talk flow like river Niger, but after e, unemployment still dey stalk us like shadow for sunset. Dem yarn USA versus us, like say na football match. Over dia, dem get programs, subsidies, even counseling for job hunters. Here? Na "hustle hard," or join di queue for government palliatives wey finish before you reach front. I laugh, because Nigerians resilient pass anything, we turn obstacle to opportunity, sell recharge card for street corner, or start small business from nothing. But e no easy, eh? Family dey press, "when you go marry, when job go come?" And you fit answer, "soon," but inside, you dey pray for dat breakthrough wey feel like miracle. Dat na where di wisdom from scripture enter: persevere, because di race no easy, but di prize eternal. No be politician promise, but divine assurance.

One more angle, dis idea wey dem push say one leader special, like chosen one from comic book. Achievements list long, from state to nation, but shey e reach ground? Roads, bridges, yes, but what of di boy wey graduate, certificate for hand, begging for chance? Or di woman wey sell tomatoes, rain fall, goods spoil, no insurance, no backup. E be like dem build castle, but forget di foundation wey ordinary folks stand on. Me I dey hope, because hope no dey disappoint when e come from right source. Not from man wey go shift goalpost, but from di one wey word no dey fail. So, even as dem visit, win elections, write letters, we hold tight, laugh at di madness, and trust say light go come, not just from NEPA, but from above.

Eh, and dis CIA agent talk, e dey tickle me die. Imagine, big man, suit sharp, but secretly reporting to Yankee bosses? Next time dem see am shake hands with foreign visitors, we go wonder, "na report time?" Absurd, but e fit explain why some decisions feel off, like shoe wey no match. But seriously, instead of fingers pointing, make we focus on home: teach youth skills, not just degrees wey gather dust. Build industries wey employ thousands, not promises wey evaporate like morning dew. And in all, remember, redemption no come from spy games, but from turning back to what matters – community, faith, hard work mixed with prayer. Because at end of day, when traffic clear, when power restore, what remain na di bonds we share, di laughs we share, and di belief say tomorrow better.

Let me wrap dis with one thought: all dis political drama, visits, wins, letters – e like Nollywood script, twist after twist, but no happy ending yet. But for real life, we write our own story, with grit and grace. So, next time you hear big news, smile, pray, and keep pushing. Because if politicians be actors, we be di directors, and di ultimate producer? Nah, dat one no dey miss cue. E go deliver di blockbuster we all waiting for.
