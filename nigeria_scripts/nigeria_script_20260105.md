Eh, my people, wetin dey happen for this our side sef? You see this matter with that big man from across the water, Donald Trump, threatening to send soldiers come scatter everything here? Chai, the guy just wake up one morning, look map, point finger, say make dem march down to Naija. As if say we no get enough wahala with our own people wey dey do like say dem own the place. Now, our leaders dey summon all those oyinbo ambassadors for Abuja, like say na family meeting to beg say no vex. But me, I dey think, shey if Trump hear say Naija get juju and pastors wey fit pray bullet back, him go still try am? Because e be like say him forget say here, even when trouble knock door, we go answer with prayer and small hustle on top.

That one dey remind me of how our politicians dey switch sides faster than chameleon for dry season. Take this Bayelsa oga for example, one day him dey PDP, shouting change and all that jazz, next day, him don land APC like say na better party wey get more rice to share. Wetin be this? Na so dem dey do, jumping from one camp to another, like say politics na Nollywood script wey dem dey rewrite every election. And the followers? Dem just follow, clapping hands, as if say the man no just change jersey mid-match. Me, I wonder, if dem continue like this, soon every politician go get their own party, like personal tailor-made one, complete with manifesto wey say "I go fix everything, except my pocket." But seriously, e dey tire person—how una expect say the country go move forward when leaders dey do musical chairs with power?

Now, talking of moving forward, make I yarn una about this Anambra election matter. Our big oga for APC dey hail am for staying neutral, like say e be some kind of saint wey no wan stain hand. Neutral? In Naija politics? Abeg, that one na just code for "I dey watch from afar, but my boys go chop quiet-quiet." Election time, everybody dey claim peace, but behind door, na who go share the cake na im matter. And the people? Dem dey queue under sun, thumb print for person wey promise heaven, only to get small pepper soup wey no even hot. Shey una no see say even Bible talk say no put trust in princes, because dem go disappoint? But we still dey do am, hoping say one day, grace go touch one of dem make dem remember say power na service, no be personal ATM.

Eh, and this Sanwo-Olu wey dey beg investors for climate change talk? The man stand for podium, talk of green energy and all, as if say Lagos no be the same place wey flood take over every rainy season. Him dey appeal to world say come put money, but e be like say him forget say here, rain fall, road turn river, and danfo drivers still dey charge extra to swim through. Imagine investor come, see okada man carrying three people plus goat for bonnet, and dem go think say na adventure park. But truth be say, if dem serious with this climate thing, first make dem fix the drainage wey dey look like somebody dig am with spoon. Because as e dey now, global warming no go kill us—our own potholes go finish the job first. And in all this, I dey find small hope, like how church people dey say even when storm come, the anchor hold. So maybe, just maybe, if leaders borrow that faith, dem fit build something wey last, no be just promise wey wash away with next rain.

You know, this whole thing with foreign threats and internal drama dey make me think of how we Nigerians dey handle pressure. Take unemployment for example—every youth dey graduate, CV for hand, but job market dey look like empty market on Sunday. Government dey talk of plans with IMF and World Bank, but dem say two years too short to fix am. Two years? Abeg, in Naija time, that na eternity! By then, the graduate don turn hustler, selling recharge card for junction or driving uber with prayer warrior mindset. And the Igbos for Lagos? Dem dey shout say one Nigeria na illusion, especially with projects wey dey favor some side more than other. Like say Tinubu na Lagos king, no be national head. E be like say dem dey build bridges for one area, while other place still dey use canoe cross stream. But wetin we go do? Complain small, laugh am off, and continue to grind, because as una know, resilience na our middle name. Even Bible yarn say in famine, the righteous no beg—dem go find way, like Joseph wey turn storehouse to blessing.

Now, shift gear small to this Babangida birthday matter. Our oga dey congratulate the former military man turn 84, like say e be normal thing to hail somebody wey once hold whip. 84 years? That man don see coup, see democracy, see everything, and still dey alive to chop cake. Me, I respect am, but e dey make me wonder if politics no be like wine—e sweet pass as e age, but sometimes e turn sour quick. And with Trump noise on top, e be like old soldiers no dey fade away; dem just wait for next drama to comment. But in Naija, we dey turn even tension to testimony, praying say God go redeem the time wey wahala don waste.

Speaking of redemption, make I touch on this doctors strike wey government dey try end. Doctors fold arm, say no pay, no work, and patients dey suffer for bed, waiting like say na faith healing. Government dey move, but slow like snail for hot sun. Imagine, you sick, go hospital, dem say strike, so you run go church for prayer warrior, or market for agbo. That na the Naija way—when system fail, we fall back on what we know: family, faith, and small jara from neighbor. Shey una no see say e dey work sometimes? Because even when light go, candle still dey shine, and heart still dey beat with hope.

And this NNPC with refinery talk, extending deal to supply crude with naira? Sound good on paper, like say we go save dollars and all, but me I dey wait see. In past, such plans don turn to another 419 story, where promise plenty, delivery scarce. But if e work, e go be like manna from heaven, easing some economic pain. Yet, with all these—threats from abroad, switches inside, appeals everywhere—e dey clear say our story no finish. We dey weave through, laughing at the absurd, holding to grace that no dey fail. Because at the end, politicians come and go, but the spirit wey push Naija forward? That one eternal, like good jollof wey stick to ribs.

Finally, picture this: if Trump really send soldiers, and dem land for Murtala Muhammed, first thing dem go meet na immigration officer wey demand bribe in dollars. Dem go think say na joke, but e go be reality check. And our boys? Dem go welcome with highlife music and small egusi, turning invasion to party. That's Naija—turning threat to testimony, wahala to wisdom. So, rest easy, world; we got this, with God on our side.
