Eh, make una hear this one wey dey make my head spin like generator wey no get fuel. You see this our big man for the top, him don go meet those World Bank people for that place wey everybody dey rush go. Him dey talk say we go fix everything quick-quick, but me I dey wonder, when last you see salary wey enter account without wahala? These oga dem promise heaven on earth, but the only heaven wey dey show for here na the one wey pastors dey preach on Sunday, complete with tithe collection plate wey never empty.

Now, let me yarn una about this other matter wey dey hot like pepper soup wey just land from the pot. This Bayelsa oga, the one wey suppose dey lead him people steady, him wake up one morning decide say PDP no longer sweet, so him jump fence go APC side. Chai, see political acrobatics! One day him dey wear red cap, next day na blue shirt. If na me, I for open betting shop for this kind switch, because e be like say party loyalty na like phone credit – e dey finish sharp-sharp when you need am most. And the people wey dey follow am, dem just dey clap, as if say na Nollywood script wey get happy ending. But truth be say, the only redemption wey fit save this kind drama na the one from above, where no politician fit bribe the judge.

Wetin dey pain me pass na how these leaders dey treat the rest of us like say we no dey count. Imagine, you dey hustle for market, selling tomatoes wey price don climb higher than Mount Kilimanjaro, then you hear say foreign investors dey get red carpet for climate change talk. Yes o, my sister Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos boss, him dey beg those big boys from outside to come pour money for green projects. Green projects ke? When our roads still dey swallow cars like anaconda? Him talk say Lagos go be model for the world, but e get one small problem – the model wey e dey show na the one wey get potholes everywhere, traffic wey fit make saint curse, and danfo drivers wey dey drive like say dem dey race Formula One with okada.

That one remind me of this talk wey dey go round about Igbos for that commercial city. Some people dey say one Nigeria na just dream, like mirage wey you see for desert but when you reach am, nothing dey. Dem claim say projects dey favor one side too much, as if the president na landlord for only one tenant. Haba, is this man ruling the whole country or just him backyard? You go think say na Bible story, where manna dey fall for only chosen few, but even Moses no do that kind partiality. Us Nigerians, we dey coexist like family wedding where in-laws dey eye each other, smiling but ready to pull knife under the table. Yet, grace dey hold us together, abi? Because if not for that divine glue, this union for don scatter since 1960.

And talking about family dynamics, e be like our economy na big family meeting wey nobody agree on agenda. Unemployment dey bite hard, like mosquito wey no carry malaria but still vex person. The oga dem from IMF dey talk say fix everything in two years, but our leaders reply say e no possible, like say dem dey confess sin for confessional. Me I like that honesty small-small, because e show say even politicians fit read Bible – the part wey talk about unrealistic expectations, like prodigal son wey think money go finish quick. But wetin dem no talk na how we the masses dey manage. You see graduate wey hold degree for hand but dey drive keke for street, or engineer wey dey fix generator because NEPA don turn darkness to national anthem. That one na test of faith, ehn? When light dey go off every five minutes, you go learn to pray harder than pastor on altar call.

Now, let us not forget this Dangote matter wey dey make noise. The refinery wey suppose end fuel wahala, now dem dey talk extension for crude supply, all in naira. Good idea on paper, but in Naija, paper na just tissue for cleaning mess. You remember how we dey queue for petrol like say na Black Friday sale for heaven's gate? Now, with this deal, maybe fuel go flow like river Jordan, but I doubt. Because if na so, why NNPC still dey play hide-and-seek with prices? Dem go extend deal, but the extension go be like elastic band wey snap back to same old problem. And the workers, those resident doctors wey dey strike, dem too dey wait for their own miracle. Government dey move to end am, but how? With promises or actual pay? E be like David and Goliath, but this time Goliath get wallet full of empty checks.

Chai, and this birthday shoutout to Babangida, the former military chief wey don clock 84. Tinubu send congrats, as if say na old school reunion. But me I dey think, at that age, wetin person need no be cake, na peace of mind from all the coups and dramas wey pass. Him dey there, smiling in pictures, but we know say history no forget. E be like prodigal father returning, and the nation dey welcome am with open arms, forgetting the past wahala. That's Naija spirit – forgive quick, but remember to laugh about it later. Because if we no laugh, the tears go flood the streets worse than rainy season.

One more thing wey dey tickle me funny na this idea of Lagos as the most dangerous state. Dangerous how? From armed robbers or from the stress wey go give person high blood pressure? Sanwo-Olu talk about challenged coexistence, like say we dey live in zoo where lion and goat dey share cage. But truth be say, in this country, danger na part of the package, like jollof rice without spice – bland but you chop am anyway. We dey navigate it with wisdom from above, quoting proverbs and psalms to keep sanity. Because politicians go come and go, but that enduring hope na the real deal.

Eh, my people, if you think say this na exaggeration, just check your pocket – empty like church offering after tax collector visit. We dey promise ourselves better tomorrow, but tomorrow dey act like Nigerian time, always late. Yet, in all this, there's that quiet assurance, the kind wey no need microphone or rally. It's the faith wey turns scarcity to testimony, turning water to wine without asking for vote. So next time you hear another policy announcement, just smile and pray, because only that go carry us through this endless comedy show called life in Naija. And who knows, maybe one day the punchline go be sweet for everybody.
