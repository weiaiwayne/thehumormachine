E don tey wey party loyalty for this country turn to market bargaining, where governors switch sides faster than trader change price when customer haggle. Take this Bayelsa matter, eh? The oga for there, just dump PDP join APC, as if e be like changing shirt for rainy day. You imagine? One day na opposition, next day na ruling party member, shaking hands with everybody like say nothing happen. E be like those old Nollywood films where hero turn villain midway, just to grab the pot of soup. And the people? Dem just dey watch, sipping garri, waiting to see who go dash dem better promise. Me, I dey think, if politicians fit switch party so easy, why una no dey allow us switch landlord when rent too high? Or switch boss when salary no dey reach? Abeg, make e be like that for everybody, so life go fair small.

Now, shift eye go that birthday shout for former military head, Babangida, turning 84. Our current leader send him congrats, full of respect, like say na family reunion for barracks. You know how e be? These old soldiers, dem no dey retire proper, dem dey hover like eagle over chicken coop, dropping wisdom or warning every now and then. 84 years, and still e dey get mention for national news, while some of us wey dey hustle daily no fit even get shoutout from neighbor. E remind me of those village elders wey sit under iroko tree, telling stories of coup and power grab, and young ones like me just nod, praying say their own turn no go come with bullet. But seriously, at 84, if I reach that age, I want my congrats to come with free fuel voucher or something practical, no be just sweet words. Politicians dey promise heaven on earth, but only the good book talk say true rest dey heaven proper. So, happy birthday, General, may your shadow no dey long too much for the young bloods.

Ehn, and this international drama with that American big man, Trump, throwing threat of army action our way? Our side summon all diplomats to Abuja, like say na school assembly to warn bad students. The response come sharp: we dey talk diplomacy, no fear, everything under control. You hear am? As if one phone call go calm down somebody wey dey tweet fire from White House. Me, I dey laugh, cos e be like those neighborhood beef where one guy shout "I go scatter your shop," and the other reply "Come try am, my brother dey your back." But on global stage, e serious o, with envoys gathering like market women for meeting. Imagine the room: suits from everywhere, sipping tea, discussing how no go let matter hot pass. And us for street? We just dey pray, cos even small wahala fit turn to big storm. Remember how Bible talk about nations rising against nations? Well, instead of sword, na now Twitter and summit dey do the fighting. Our leaders dey assure say grace go cover us, and truly, if diplomacy no work, faith go bridge the gap.

Speaking of bridging gaps, look at this doctors' strike wey government dey try end. Resident doctors fold arm, no dey attend patient, and oga at top move to settle am quick quick. You know the wahala? Hospital turn ghost town, people wey need checkup now dey resort to herbalist or prayer warrior. E be like say health care don join the queue of things wey dey scarce, beside good road and steady job. I remember one time, my cousin fall sick, rush hospital, only to find doctor on strike, so we carry am go church for healing service. And e work, glory to God, cos sometimes human hand fail, but divine touch no dey disappoint. Government promise to fix am, maybe with better pay or condition, but e too late for some. Why una no think of this before? Politicians dey travel abroad for small cough, but for common man, na now dem remember doctor matter. If strike continue, next time I go tell patient, "Sorry, go see Jesus, he no dey strike."

Then, over in that commercial city, the state head, Sanwo-Olu, dey appeal to world investors for climate change summit. E yarn about green energy, sustainable future, all that fancy talk, as if e be TED talk for Davos. You see am? While flood dey swallow community, heat dey roast everybody, him dey invite foreign money to come build solar panel or tree farm. Sound good on paper, but for ground, na same old story: promise plenty, deliver small. Imagine investor from abroad, hearing "Come put money, we go save planet," and him ask, "But wetin about the pothole wey swallow my tire on the way here?" E be irony, cos climate change dey hit us hard—rain no dey stop, sun no dey mercy—yet leaders dey pose with mic, talking big. Me, I support am, cos if foreign cash come, maybe e go trickle down to buy fan for my room. And in all this, e sweet how faith enter: even as world dey hot, the scripture remind say God control the weather, no be man alone. So, investors, come o, but remember, true change start from heart, no be just pocket.

Now, tie all these together, and you see the pattern for our political dance: switch party, celebrate old guard, dodge foreign punch, fix strike, chase green dollar. E be like juju mix, where ingredient plenty, but taste no dey consistent. And the people? We dey endure, laughing to survive, praying for redemption. Cos at the end, politicians go come and go, but the one wey never fail dey watch from above. So, next time you hear news of governor jump fence or leader clap for general, just smile and say, "Na God dey run am." And if Trump call bluff, tell am we get our own ace—prayer warriors wey no dey back down. Stay strong, my brothers and sisters, cos in this comedy called life, the punchline always point to hope.
