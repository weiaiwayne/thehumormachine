Ah, my people, my people! Una good evening o! You dey feel the heat? Lagos is burning hotter than a politician’s lies after election! Honestly, I needed a cold Star before I could even begin to talk about the state of our Naija.

So, I was online today, ehn? Reddit, Nairaland… everywhere is on fire! You know how it is. Every day, new wahala. I saw one thread saying, "Wicked leaders or docile people?" I nearly spat out my zobo! Docile? My brother, we’re not docile! We’re… patiently waiting. Waiting for the miracle that will never come, probably.

Na true sha, we dey complain, but who dey actually *do* something? One guy on Reddit said he’s building a tool to track public officials. I say, good for him! But will it actually work? Will it stop them from pocketing our money like garri? I doubt it.

President Tinubu is trying, I guess. Addressing economic and security issues. But me I dey ask, which economy? The one where pure water is now N50? The one where fuel price is higher than my rent? Bros, I’m feeling the "Renewed Hope" in my pocket – renewed emptiness, that is!

And that cybercrime act? Hmmm. They say it’s to protect us. But I just know they will use it to silence anyone who criticize government small. Freedom of speech? Sorry o, that one dey travel agent’s hand, for abroad package only.

Speaking of abroad, I saw one headline saying Benin City had streetlights before London! See, we used to be something! We were shining bright like… well, like streetlights in Benin City before NEPA took light! Now, London is shining, and we are… patiently waiting for fuel subsidy to return. *Wait, what?* Did I just say that? God forbid! May my village people not hear me!

You know, I remember back in university, we went to protest against ASUU strike. We were chanting, we were marching, we were feeling like revolutionary heroes! The police just looked at us, yawned, and started playing Whot. Whot! That's when I knew. Nigeria is a comedy. A very dark comedy, but comedy nonetheless.

The 2023 election, ehn? Low female representation in government. Shame! How are we expecting to progress when half the population no dey at the table? It's like cooking jollof rice with only tomatoes and no pepper. The taste will just be...flat.

And all these political parties, deregistering some, forming new ones… it’s like a Nollywood movie script. Every scene, new drama. Every character, different agenda. All of them just want to chop national cake. Na we the citizens, we dey bake the cake, but we no dey get slice. We just dey smell the aroma and manage.

But you know what? We go still dey laugh. We go still dey make jokes. Because if we no laugh, we go cry. And if we cry, who go give us tissue? Abeg, pass me another bottle of Star. I need to renew my hope, one bottle at a time. Remember the guy who built the website? Let's hope he's built it on a server based outside Nigeria. Just in case. You know how we do!
