Make una imagine this thing wey dey happen for our country these days, like say politics don turn to one big Nollywood movie, full of twists wey nobody see coming. You see this Bayelsa governor, him just wake up one morning, dust him agbada, and decide say PDP no longer sweet am. Him jump ship go APC, like say na market wey dem dey change stall because the other one get better price. Wahala o, because now everybody dey wonder, how many more governors go follow? Shey dem go line up like queue for bank, waiting to switch? And Tinubu, our big oga for top, him just dey smile, probably thinking, welcome home, brother, we get rice and beans for you here.

But hold on, that one no even finish. Over there for the North, one top governor don open mouth talk say for 2027, him fit dump APC go back to Atiku side. Atiku? The man wey dey like fine wine, the older him get, the more him dey relevant? This governor dey reason am like say politics na football match, where you fit change team at halftime if the score no favor you. Me sef, I dey ask, wetin be the problem? Is it the heat from the sun up North, or na the promises wey APC make wey no show? Nigerians, una see this thing? Politicians dey play musical chairs with parties, while we, the masses, dey sit down one place, watching dem dance.

Speaking of dancing around issues, let's talk about this Anambra election. Lagos APC don hail Tinubu say him neutral, like say him dey referee match wey him own team dey play. Neutral? In Nigerian politics? That one na miracle, abi? Usually, neutrality mean say you dey wait to see who win before you pick side, but Tinubu, him sit tight, no wahala. Maybe him learn from Bible, that story of Solomon wey divide the baby but no really divide am, just to show wisdom. Shey Tinubu dey do the same? Or na strategy to avoid the Igbos for Lagos shouting say one Nigeria na illusion? Because, you know how e be, one day dem dey buy land for Lekki, next day dem dey claim say Lagos too dangerous. But neutral Tinubu, him dey like that pastor wey preach peace to both sides, hoping say grace go cover the rest.

Now, this one wey dey make my head hot pass hot plate jollof is the whole drama with Trump. That man over there for America, him wake up, tweet say him go send military come Nigeria, like say we be his backyard wey need sweeping. And our government? Dem summon all foreign diplomats for Abuja, like say na town hall meeting for primary school. Tinubu respond say dem dey engage diplomatically, assuring everybody say no shaking. Diplomatically? With Trump? The man wey talk anyhow, like say him mouth no get filter? I dey laugh, because imagine, Nigerian diplomats siddon for table with Americans, explaining say our wahala no need bullet, na just fuel and naira we need fix. But Trump, him probably thinking, Nigeria? Dem get oil, but dem no get wall, so make I build one with tanks.

And while dem dey talk military threat, our own house dey burn with small small fire. Like this doctors' strike wey government wan end. Resident doctors dey fold arm, say salary no reach, while patients dey queue like for danfo bus during rush hour. Government say dem go fix am now, after how many months? Shey na because Trump noise make dem remember say health na national security? Or na the grace of God wey dey touch heart, like that prodigal son story, where the father run welcome am back? But doctors, una deserve better, because without una, who go treat this political headache wey we get? Imagine if strike continue, politicians go run go India for checkup, while we dey manage paracetamol from roadside chemist.

That reminds me of something else wey dey sweet but sour. This NNPC and Dangote refinery deal, dem dey talk to extend naira-based crude supply. Naira? For crude oil? In a world where dollar dey rule like king? Dangote, that man wey build refinery like say na his personal jollof pot, now dey use naira pay for fuel wey go save our economy. But wait, how e go work? Because last time, refinery open, fuel price jump like frog for rainy season. Now, extension? Shey na to make sure say naira no go crash more, or na ploy to keep Dangote smiling while we dey count kobo for market? I dey tell una, this one na like that biblical manna from heaven – e fall, but e no last if you no manage am well. Politicians promise say e go sweet, but we know how e be, promise na like NEPA light, e come and go.

And oh, Tinubu congratulate former military president Babangida at 84. IBB, the man wey rule with iron hand back in day, now dey collect birthday wishes like grandpa wey dey share sweets. 84 years? In Nigeria, that na achievement, because stress from politics fit shorten life like bad generator fuel. Tinubu say happy birthday, probably reminiscing those old days of coup and annulment. But IBB at 84, him dey like wine wey age well – still sharp, still got stories wey fit fill book. Shey him go advice Tinubu on this Trump matter? Or na just cake and small chop? Nigerians, una see? Even old soldiers no dey fade, dem just dey wait for next battle.

But let's not forget the small people in all this big man talk. You know how e be for Lagos, traffic dey hold you down while governors dey switch parties like channel. One day, you dey danfo, sweating under sun, thinking about unemployment wey government dey tackle with USA help – or so dem say. But what dem doing? Seminars and promises, while youth dey hustle for okada or yahoo. And Igbos for Lagos, dem dey shout say one Nigeria na mirage, especially with lopsided projects wey make e look like Tinubu na Lagos president. Projects everywhere for island, but upcountry? Na promise wey dey like rainbow – beautiful but you no fit touch am.

Even when all this dey happen, I remember say in the midst of storm, there's that quiet faith wey no shake. Like how Jesus calm the sea for his disciples, even when wave dey high. Politicians go threaten and switch, Trump go bark, but that higher power wey dey watch no dey play politics. E dey like the light wey NEPA no fit take – steady, reliable. So while we laugh at this madness, make we hold that hope, because redemption no dey come from ballot box alone, e come from above.

Now, this northern governor talking Atiku for 2027, him fit be the one to watch. Imagine if all dem dump APC, na wetin go happen? Party go empty like market after rain. Or shey Tinubu go use him neutrality charm to pull dem back? But me, I dey pray say by that time, we go get leaders wey no dey jump ship, wey stand firm like the rock wey Moses strike for water. Because Nigeria, we tire for this musical chairs; we wan sit down and build something lasting.

And on that doctors' note, government moving to end strike – praise God! But make dem no just end am with promise wey evaporate. Pay dem well, because health na wealth, and without doctors, who go heal this nation wey wound plenty? Imagine Trump hear say our hospitals empty, him go think say e easy to invade. No, make we fix inside first, with grace and hard work.

Finally, this Dangote deal, if e work, naira go breathe small. But if e flop, na back to dollar wahala. Dangote, you be our hero, but even heroes need prayer, like David facing Goliath with stone and faith. So una, as we dey navigate this 2026 politics, make we laugh, but make we also believe say better day dey come – not from politicians alone, but from that unchanging promise above. And if Trump still dey noise, tell am say Nigeria strong, we get refinery, we get faith, and we no need him army; we get God on our side.
