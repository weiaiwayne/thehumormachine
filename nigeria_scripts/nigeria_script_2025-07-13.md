Omo, Naija! How una dey? You people look tired. Abi na the country? Don’t worry, laughter is the best medicine… although these days, even paracetamol na luxury. You know, I saw one guy arguing with the pharmacist, he wanted to pay for Panadol in Bitcoin. Bitcoin! I asked him, "Oga, are you sure you're not Nigerian? Because this hustle is next level."

So, Tinubu is still in charge, eh? Still “re-strategizing” our economy. I hear say dem don change the CBN governor again. Another one! At this rate, we go soon start auctioning the post on Jumia. "CBN Governor, slightly used, low mileage, previous owner drove it once." I tell you, if confusion was a country, Nigeria would be its capital.

Amnesty International say over 10,000 people don die since Tinubu take over. 10,000! That's like the entire population of one local government. Kai! But don't worry, government officials say they are "concerned." Concerned! Like when you see your neighbor’s house on fire and you just stand outside shouting “Ah! This is not good o! This is not good at all!”

And the 2027 elections are already heating up. Opposition forming alliances. Alliances upon alliances. It's like they’re playing musical chairs, but the chair is the Aso Rock Villa. Everybody wan siddon. But let’s be honest, after all the alliances, mergers, and grand coalitions, we still end up with the same characters, just wearing different agbadas. It’s like changing the wrapper of moimoi, but the moimoi inside is still the same – beans!

Speaking of alliances, I saw one post on Reddit, one American babe asking if she’s wrong for dating a Nigerian guy living in Nigeria for two years. Two years! My sister, you haven't started yet. Wait till he starts talking about his "village people" and how they need to "clear the ground" before you can visit. Then you’ll know say Naija matter don enter your matter fully!

And flights within Africa? Jesus! You want to fly from Lagos to Accra, it’s cheaper to fly to Dubai and back! Na wa o! We're supposed to be Pan-African, but our airlines are practicing neo-colonialism on each other. They're saying it's about high demand and fuel costs. I say it's about greed! Pure, unadulterated Naija-style greed! Remember that time fuel scarcity made pure water more expensive than fuel? Ah! Good times… good times. (That's sarcasm, just in case NEPA cut light and you can't see my face.)

The tribalism online sef is reaching fever pitch. Yoruba vs Igbo vs Hausa. It’s like… wait, what?… didn’t we fight a war about this already? Are we going to start another one on TikTok now? People dey take DNA tests to prove dem tribe. DNA! As if your ancestor’s blood determines whether you’ll pay your PHCN bill on time. Let me tell you, my DNA is probably 50% Indomie noodles and 50% pure stubbornness. That's the real Naija mix.

But you know what? Despite everything, I still love this country. I swear. Maybe it’s Stockholm Syndrome, maybe it’s because my mama’s jollof is too sweet. But Nigeria is like that troublesome child you can't help but love. We complain, we shout, we threaten to leave, but at the end of the day, we still here. Suffering and smiling. Just like those CBN Governors... concerned, very concerned. God bless Naija! And God help us all.
