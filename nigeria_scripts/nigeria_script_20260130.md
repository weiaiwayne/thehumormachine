Wetin dey happen for this our country sef, e be like say politicians don turn musical chairs game, but instead of chairs, na party logos dem dey swap. You hear am? Bayelsa governor just jump from PDP to APC, like say e wake up one morning and decide say him belle full for opposition wahala. Na so e be, one day you dey red, next day you dey blue, and everybody dey clap as if na promotion. Me, I dey think say if dem continue like this, soon we go get rainbow coalition wey go confuse even Noah himself. Shey you understand? Because even for Bible, Judas change side once, but here dem dey change like underwear after rainy season.

That one no too shock me though, but the real drama na how Enugu governor follow go meet the big oga after him own defection. E be like say na pilgrimage dem dey do, trekking from one camp to the other, collecting anointing oil along the way. Imagine, you defect, then you rush go Abuja for photo op, smiling like say you don win lottery. But wetin dem no tell una be say behind those smiles, na calculation dey go on – who get the juiciest portfolio, who go control the funds for road wey never complete. Nigerians, we sabi this script too well; e be like those market women wey change stall position every market day, but still dey sell the same rotten tomatoes. And the rest of us? We just dey watch, buying whatever dem drop, hoping say e no too bitter.

Now, make we yarn about this international matter wey don turn our foreign affairs department into emergency ward. American president, that Trump guy, dey talk military threat, and our government summon every diplomat for Abuja, like say na town hall meeting for jollof rice. E be like say dem gather say, "Oya, una explain wetin this oyinbo man mean by him noise." Me, I laugh because na so e dey be – one side dey bark, other side dey fetch water to calm the fire. But seriously, wetin be this threat sef? E be like say Trump dey watch too much Nollywood action films and think say Naija na sequel to him wall-building project. Our leaders reply say dem dey handle am diplomatically, assuring everybody say peace na the way. Diplomatic how? By sharing garri and groundnut? Or by quoting proverbs wey go make even Solomon nod?

E remind me of those times when family wahala enter village square, and elders start mediation with kola nut and palm wine. But here, na global stage, and we dey play the underdog role perfectly. Nigerians, we resilient sha – even when oyinbo dey threaten thunder and lightning, we still dey hustle under the same sun. And through it all, I dey remember say, as e dey for scriptures, the race no be for the swift, but for who endure till the end. So, while dem dey diplomatize, we go continue our daily grind, trusting say higher power go sort the rest.

Shifting gear small, you see this our Lagos state governor, Sanwo-Olu, wey dey appeal to global investors over climate change matter? E be like say him don turn environmental pastor, calling on world to come invest for green projects. Thursday, him make the call, talking international climate summit style. But wait first, Lagos wey traffic dey cause more carbon than factory, now dey preach sustainability? E sweet me die. Imagine, danfo buses blowing smoke like dragon, generators humming 24/7 because power no dey stable, and him dey tell investors say come build eco-friendly bridges. Which kain bridge? The one wey go fly over hold-up or the one wey go generate breeze for free?

Na so e be for Naija – we get vision, but execution na another story. Him dey talk renewal, appealing for funds to tackle flooding wey turn streets to river Nile every rainy season. Global investors, if una dey listen, come o, but bring life jackets too, because Third Mainland Bridge fit turn submarine any moment. And while una dey calculate ROI, remember say here, investment mean you go share profit with area boys and union people. But on a real note, e inspiring how leaders dey try pivot to future issues, even amidst the chaos. E be like David facing Goliath with slingshot made of recycled plastic – hope say e go sling true.

Speaking of birthdays and old soldiers, our president congratulate former military head, Babangida, as him clock 84. E be like family reunion for barracks, with messages of long life and wisdom. Babangida, the gap-toothed general wey step on mines but no blow up – na legend. Now at 84, him still dey relevant, collecting accolades like collector plate. Me, I dey wonder if politicians dey take special elixir, because dem no dey age normal. Him congratulate am on neutrality for Anambra matter too, APC hailing the balance. Neutrality? In Naija politics? That one na miracle, like parting Red Sea on dry land.

But e get sense for it – at 84, you don see enough coup and election to know say middle ground na safest. Nigerians, we respect our elders, even when dem cause the wahala wey we dey manage today. And as Christians, we know say gray hair na crown of glory, so happy birthday to IBB, may your steps remain steady, and your stories keep entertaining. Who knows, maybe next year dem go invite am to advise on this Trump noise.

Now, on a lighter side, this whole diplomatic summon over threat don spark online plenty. People dey meme am, saying na time for Naija to export our peaceful vibes instead of oil. One brother talk say, "If Trump wan send army, make dem come learn how we survive without light for weeks – that na real boot camp." Another one yarn, "Our government dey reply with diplomacy? Next dem go send delegation with suya to Washington." E be pure gold, this our online comedy. Shows say no matter the pressure, we find way to laugh, turning fear to punchline. That's the Naija spirit – uncrushable, like palm kernel under mortar.

And tying it back to faith, e be like Joseph for Egypt, interpreting dreams amid famine – our leaders dey navigate these storms, and we dey hold on, believing say redemption dey come. Even when threats fly and defections multiply, grace dey cover us. Politicians may switch jerseys, but God's team no dey relegate anybody.

Finally, if this political merry-go-round no stop soon, I fear say soon dem go introduce new party: the Defectors United, with manifesto promising eternal power rotation. But until then, we go keep watching, laughing, and praying say better days ahead. Because in the end, no be who run fastest, but who finish the race with joy wey matter.
