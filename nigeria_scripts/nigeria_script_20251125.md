Eh, my people, you hear this one? Our oga for the top, Tinubu, just wake up one day and decide to send invitation to every foreign big man in Abuja, like say na wedding we dey plan. All because some Yankee president elect, Trump, open mouth talk say e go send soldiers come here if things no straight. Me, I dey laugh, because which kain drama be this? Imagine, instead of we Nigerians to handle our matter inside family, we now call uncle from abroad to come mediate. But wait, no be so e dey work? You sabi how when two brothers dey fight for compound, mama go call pastor to come pray, but here na full embassy people dem gather. Abi you think say dem go come with rice and stew? No o, dem go come with briefcases full of questions, and our side go answer with that classic Naija smile, the one wey say everything dey under control even when e no dey.

Now, picture this scene in my head, eh. The foreign diplomats sit down for that big hall, sweating under AC wey dey fight to stay on, and Tinubu's people dey explain say no worry, we dey talk diplomacy. Diplomacy? That word alone suppose make anybody laugh. In Naija, diplomacy na when you go market, see price high, but you sweet-talk the seller till e drop am small. So, dem dey do the same with Trump? Call am, say oga, abeg, no send your boys, make we settle am with jollof challenge or something. But seriously, my brothers and sisters, this threat of military action, e remind me of those old Nollywood films where the villain from America come cause wahala, only for our hero to win with pure ginger. Yet, here we are in real life, hoping say the grace of God go cover us, because man's plan fit fail, but divine protection no dey expire.

That aside, let me yarn you about this other matter wey dey make me shake head. You know that former military oga, Babangida, just clock 84? And Tinubu send am congratulatory message, like say na birthday card from primary school friend. IBB, the man wey use rule with iron fist back in the day, now dey receive well-wishes like elder statesman for church anniversary. Eh, time no dey lie o. Imagine, the same person wey announce coup on radio, making heart skip for everybody, now dey celebrated with cake and prayers. Me, I dey wonder, wetin e dey do for those 84 years? Probably sitting down, reminiscing how e cross from one era to another, while we young ones still dey struggle with current bills. But e good to see, abi? Shows say even soldiers fit age into wisdom, and with God's mercy, we all go reach that stage where past wahala turn to just stories for grandkids. No be small thing, surviving that long in this our condition.

Speaking from the heart, this whole political scene dey teach us lesson on endurance, like that Bible story of Job wey hold body through fire. Politicians come and go, threats from outside dey fly, but the faith wey we carry na the real anchor. Without am, how person go face daily grind? Take this oil industry plan wey the minister just unveil, for example. Dem say e go transform everything, make Nigeria shine like new refinery. Sound sweet, eh? But you know how these plans dey? Dem announce with fanfare, promise heaven on earth, then next thing na small adjustment here, U-turn there, like the recent one on that 15 percent tariff for fuel imports. One day dem say yes, next day no, like indecisive boyfriend. Me, I dey tell you, if oil transformation na the key, why e no start with fixing the roads wey tanker dey ply? Because smooth journey mean less breakdown, and who no like progress wey dey touch pocket directly?

Eh, and don't get me start on this unemployment matter wey everybody dey battle. You see how the American government dey push their own agenda, while our side dey reply IMF say two years too short to fix wahala? Realistic talk, but my people, the youth dem no get time for long story. Graduate today, tomorrow dey hawk pure water for street, dreaming of that breakthrough. I remember one time, my cousin finish school, send CV everywhere, even to those international bodies, but na "position no available" everywhere. So now, e dey do small business, selling phone accessories under bridge. That's Naija spirit, turning lemon to lemonade, but with prayer on top, because man no fit do am alone. The Good Book talk say hope dey not disappoint, so we hold on, waiting for that divine connection wey go link us to better days. Imagine if politicians learn from that, instead of lopsided projects wey make person ask if na only one region dey exist.

Now, this trip wey Tinubu dey plan go Japan and Brazil, e dey sweet my ear. Oga wan go learn how dem dey run things, bring ideas back home. Good move, because if we no borrow leaf from others, how we go grow? But you sabi Naija twist? Dem go go there, eat sushi and feijoada, sign agreement, come back and say implementation start next year. Meanwhile, the people wey need the change dey here, facing coexistence challenge like that one Sanwo-Olu talk about for his state. Dangerous times, but we dey manage with community spirit, sharing what little we get. It's like family gathering where uncle from village come complain of hunger, but everybody chip in to make e feel welcome. That's how we survive, with that mix of sarcasm and faith, laughing through the pain.

Let me paint another picture for una. This extraordinary Nigerian teen wey dey make waves, doing things wey adults no fit imagine. While big men dey argue over parties – like that Bayelsa oga wey switch side from PDP to APC, jumping like frog in rainy season – the young ones dey innovate. No time for old drama, dem dey build apps, create content, turning nothing to something. Me, I salute am, because in this economy where naira dey dance zigzag, inspiration from such stories na fuel for soul. And talking soul, remember how the Psalmist say youth shall renew their strength like eagle? Exactly, these kids dey show us say future bright, even if present dey cloudy. Politicians fit dump one camp for another, but the real power na in the generation wey no dey tire.

One more thing wey dey tickle me: this talk of Igbos in the city, saying one nation na illusion. Deep o, but wey make am funny na how everybody dey claim their corner like football teams. Yet, when hunger knock, we all gather for same amala spot, no tribal line. That's the absurdity, my people – shouting division by day, uniting by belly come evening. And with God's grace, e go better, because love your neighbor no dey select tribe. Imagine if leaders follow that rule, no more hiding when former oga come visit, like that Buhari matter for the city. Straight face, open arms, problem solve.

Finally, this Nigerian condition, eh, na full comedy script written by life itself. From drummers confessing their hustle to foods wey rank high in heart, we dey manage. But through it all, the redemption story dey play – from threat to talk, from switch to stability, all under watchful eye above. So, next time wahala knock, just smile and say, na God win at the end.
