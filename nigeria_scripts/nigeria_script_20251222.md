Eh, my people, una don hear about this wahala wey President Tinubu dey face with that American big man, Donald Trump? The one wey dey talk say him go send soldiers come here like say Naija be some playground for him to scatter. Omo, when I read am for newspaper, I just shake my head. Imagine o, one minute you dey enjoy your pepper soup for corner, next thing, boom, Yankee army dey knock on your door asking for jollof recipe by force. But Tinubu no send, him summon all those foreign diplomats for Abuja, like say him dey host village meeting to settle palava. Shey you understand? Him say him government dey engage diplomatically, but me I know say na to beg dem make dem no come with those big guns wey fit turn our roads to craters.

Now, think am through. Trump dey over there, sitting pretty with him gold toilet, threatening military action because of some border drama or wetin? While here, we dey manage with potholes wey swallow cars whole. If dem come, wetin dem go do? March down our streets, step on okada wey dey dodge traffic, only to get lost because even GPS no fit navigate Third Mainland properly. And when dem see our hustle, dem go tire sharp sharp. One soldier go try collect bribe from conductor, another go join queue for fuel wey no dey, before you know, dem go defect and start selling suya under bridge. Abi, no be so? But seriously, this thing remind me of how we Nigerians always turn crisis to comedy. Even Bible talk say in times of trouble, wisdom from above go guide you, like how David face Goliath with just stone and faith. Tinubu better borrow that leaf, no be to summon diplomats alone.

Speaking of surprises, you see wetin happen for Bayelsa? That governor wey been dey PDP like loyal husband, suddenly dump am and run go APC like say na better party wey get more rice to share. O boy, politics for Naija na like Nollywood film, full of twists wey you no expect. One day you dey opposition, shouting change, next you dey ruling party, clapping for the same people wey you used to curse. Him reason? Maybe say PDP no dey pay salary on time, or perhaps APC promise am private jet to fly im family go Dubai. But e funny how these switches happen, like changing SIM card when airtime finish. The people for Bayelsa sef, dem just dey watch, shaking head, wondering if e go bring better roads or just more promises wey go evaporate like morning dew.

And e no stop there. While all this dey happen, Tinubu still find time to congratulate former military president Babangida on him 84th birthday. IBB, the man wey rule with iron hand back in day, now dey collect well wishes like grandpa wey survive family reunion. Tinubu say him dey celebrate a life of service, but me I dey think, service to who? To the nation or to him pocket? E be like say politicians dey age like fine wine, the older, the sweeter the stories dem tell. But on the real, turning 84 for Naija no small thing. You don dodge coups, inflation, and even those long queues for rice subsidy. E get as e be, like the prodigal son wey come back home, and father welcome am with open arms. Grace dey cover plenty sins, abi? Even when leaders mess up, if dem show little remorse, we go forgive, because that's our Naija spirit – resilient like palm tree in harmattan.

Now, shift gear small to Lagos State. Governor Sanwo-Olu dey appeal to global investors about climate change, talking big about international conference and how Lagos go lead the way in green energy. Him say on Thursday, him make renewed call, like say investors dey wait for him voice before dem bring money. Oga, climate change for Lagos? The rain wey dey fall like punishment from heaven, flooding streets till danfo turn submarine. Or the sun wey dey roast you alive while you dey trek because bus fare don hike. Him wan attract investors, but first, make him fix the drainage wey be like forgotten gutter from colonial days. Imagine foreign money coming, only to see our market women selling under polythene wey tear every rainy season. Dem go run back sharp sharp. But e sweet to see leaders trying, even if na eye service. Remember that parable of talents? The one wey bury him own, master vex. So Sanwo-Olu better invest well, no be to talk for mic alone.

And talking about health, the government dey move to end that resident doctors' strike. Doctors wey been fold arm, saying salary no reach, now dem dey negotiate like market hagglers. Na so life be for Naija – strike today, settlement tomorrow, then back to queue for hospital wey no get bed. Imagine if doctors strike worldwide, but here, we understand the struggle. Dem dey save lives, but who go save dem from this economy wey bite harder than mosquito? E be like Paul wey say contentment with what you have, but e hard when even paracetamol sef don cost like gold. I pray say dem reach agreement quick, because one day, e fit be your brother or sister wey need that operation. Faith without work na dead, so make government work make peace reign.

But wait, there's more drama. Tinubu inherit economy wey Oshiomhole call badly mismanaged from Buhari days, saying shambles everywhere. Oshiomhole, the small man with big voice, dey defend like lawyer for court. Him say no be Tinubu fault, na previous tenant wey leave house in mess. But my brother, wetin you dey do now? Clean am or add more dirt? Nigerians dey suffer, jobless youth wandering like lost sheep, waiting for shepherd wey go lead to green pasture. Unemployment na thief in the night, stealing dreams before dem form. What the USA and Naija governments dey do? Talk plenty, action small. Maybe if dem borrow from biblical wisdom, teach people skills like fishermen wey Jesus multiply fish. Turn water to wine, or better, turn jobless to employed.

Even with all this, Igbos for Lagos dey talk say one Nigeria na mirage, like oasis wey you chase but no reach. Projects wey seem lopsided, like say president na for one state alone. Allegations flying left and right, but deep down, we know unity na the key, even if e scratch sometimes. Like that Prodigal Son again, come back, share the feast. No be fight forever.

And Tinubu dey meet World Bank chiefs, departing for Japan and Brazil, hopping planes like butterfly. While we here dey manage with what we get. Him go negotiate loans, promise reforms, but hope say e no be another debt trap. IMF sef dey talk say unrealistic to fix problems in two years. Of course! Rome no build in day, and Naija problems na like Goliath – giant wey need strategy. But with faith, small stone fit do wonders.

Finally, on that note of coexistence, Sanwo-Olu talk about Nigeria's challenged living together. Lagos as most dangerous state? Na lie, na the most vibrant, where Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa mix like stew ingredients. Even if wahala plenty, we still chop am together. Politicians promise heaven on earth, but only the one upstairs delivers true peace. So, as we laugh at these dramas, make we hold faith tight – because in the end, grace go win, and we go dance to better days. No be by power or might, but by spirit. And that, my people, na the real punchline.
