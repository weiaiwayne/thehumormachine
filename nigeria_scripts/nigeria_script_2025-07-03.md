Oya, good evening, my people! Chijioke Eze is your host tonight. How una dey? You know say if you dey Nigeria and you ask person "How you dey?", the answer is always "We dey manage." Even Dangote dey manage!

So, where do we even start with this our Naija? The political climate be like harmattan – dusty, dry, and makes you cough every five minutes. Tinubu, baba himself, he dey try. I won't lie. He's trying to... what exactly is he trying to do? That one, I still dey figure out. Fuel subsidy gone, dollar climbing like say e wan reach heaven, and my salary still dey look me with one kain eye.

You know, I was at a wedding last weekend. Very posh affair. My cousin from abroad, she came looking like a full-blown Australian summer, complaining about her tailor in Nigeria messing up her dress. Tailor sent the dress four days before the wedding while she’s in Aussie. E be like say the tailor use juju finish the dress. Tell me say you no go vex?

And speaking of vex, this Peter Obi matter… Ha! I saw one Reddit post ehn, “My experience with Peter Obi was absolutely terrible…” I clicked. The person just wanted to cause trouble! Said he saw Obi twice. Twice! That’s your terrible experience? Oga, come and share my own terrible experience of trying to buy garri for Lagos market with my salary and then we talk about terrible experiences.

But seriously, these politicians. They’re all the same, abi? Promise heaven and earth before election, then disappear into thin air after. E be like say dem go join Baba Suwe for heaven. Last time, I remember one politician promised us constant light. Constant light! Now, NEPA no even bother to come. They just send you text, "Sorry, no light today. Maybe tomorrow. Or next week. Or next year. Abeg, buy generator."

Wait, what? Did I just receive a NEPA text? I swear, these guys are listening to my jokes! They're getting too comfortable.

And this AI thing sef. I saw a Reddit thread discussing how to handle AI generated content. E reach to discuss am o. I dey fear say one day, AI go write my jokes for me. Then I go dey unemployed, dey join the queue for rice wey government dey share. God forbid bad thing!

But you know what? Despite everything, I still love this country. We complain, we grumble, we even threaten to relocate to Canada every other week. But when you see Nigerians abroad, killing it in different fields, you go know say we get something special. We get that Naija spirit, that hustle, that… that ability to laugh even when things are tough.

Remember that fuel subsidy thing I talked about earlier? The hardship? Well, I heard say government wan give us palliatives. Palliatives! E be like say dem wan share paracetamol for headache wey don turn to brain tumor. But we go collect am sha. Because, you know, Nigerian wey sabi, no dey refuse free thing. Abi I lie?

So, let's raise our glasses to Nigeria! May our light bill be manageable, may our garri never finish, and may our politicians finally remember say dem dey there to serve us, not to chop us. Cheers!
