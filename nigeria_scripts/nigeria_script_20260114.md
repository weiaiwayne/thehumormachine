Oh, make we yarn about this madness wey dey happen for our side these days, especially with how our leaders dey handle visitors from abroad. You see, dem summon all those foreign diplomats to Abuja, all because one big man from America don open mouth waka say him fit send troops come our backyard. E be like say na film we dey watch, but this one na real life, abi? Imagine, ambassadors from everywhere, from China to Canada, dem dey queue up like passengers for Oshodi motor park, waiting to hear wetin our oga for top go tell dem. And the response? We dey talk diplomacy, we dey engage, as if na negotiation for pure water price for market. Shey you no see say even when outsiders dey threaten thunder, we still dey play the cool guy, sipping kunu and promising peace? But deep down, e dey remind me of those Bible stories where David face Goliath with stone, no be AK-47. Na so God dey work, turning threats to testimonies, you understand?

Now, shift gear small to this Bayelsa matter wey dey make plenty noise. The governor there, him don carry him load, dump the old party wey him used to rock with, and jump fence go join the other side. E be like say na musical chairs for politicians, every time the music stop, dem dey find new seat. One day na red, next day na broom, tomorrow who knows, maybe him go invent rainbow party. Wetin dey funny be say, the people wey dey follow am, dem dey hail am like hero, but e be like changing church branch – same sermon, different choir. And the followers? Dem dey argue up and down, some dey call am betrayal, others dey say na wisdom. Me, I dey think say if politicians fit switch party like we dey switch SIM cards for better network, why una no dey switch for better roads or steady water? E go save us plenty stress. But na so life be, even Paul wey write half Bible, him change from persecutor to preacher. Grace dey cover ground, ehn, even for those wey dey jump ship.

E get this other side wey dey touch heart – our president don send birthday wishes to that old general, Babangida, as him clock 84. Eighty-four years, my people! That man don see war, coup, civilian rule, everything under sun. Him dey there, still sharp like cutlass, and we dey celebrate am with messages wey full of respect. But think am well, e be like toasting to a vintage wine wey never spoil, even after plenty fermentation. Politicians dey congratulate am, but I dey wonder, wetin him dey think now, sitting back, watching the young ones scramble for power? Probably laughing inside, remembering how him used to draw annulment lines for election results. Na lesson for us all – age no dey carry wisdom go dustbin. And for those wey dey power today, make una learn say, one day una go sit back too, and the cake go be for una. Bible talk say wisdom come with gray hair, so at 84, that man na walking library. If we fit borrow small from am, maybe our own leaders go stop this constant back-and-forth.

Speaking of health and healing, una hear about this move to end the resident doctors strike? Finally, after months of hospitals turning to ghost towns, dem dey talk settlement, dey promise to fix the wah I mean, the issues wey dey ground work. Doctors wey suppose dey save lives, dem dey picket lines, carrying placards like market women bargaining for tomatoes. And patients? Dem dey suffer, running from one herbalist to another, or just praying for miracle. E pain me say, in a country wey plenty challenges, even healers dey need healing. But praise be, if dem resolve am quick, e go be like manna from heaven, restoring normalcy. You know how we Nigerians do – when strike dey, we improvise, but deep down, we dey cry for better system. Reminds me of that scripture where Jesus heal the sick without strike notice. If our leaders fit channel that energy, hospitals go turn Mecca for health, no more queuing like for rice subsidy.

Now, let me no forget this international angle again, with our man heading out to Japan and Brazil, departing the capital on Thursday. E be like say, instead of fixing potholes here, him dey go learn how dem dey build bridges abroad. Japan with their bullet trains, Brazil with carnival vibes – wetin we go bring back? Maybe some tech to fix our power, or dance moves to lighten economic load. But seriously, while him dey jet-set, we here dey hustle, dodging rain wey no get gutter to flow. E funny how leaders travel for solution, but solution no dey travel back with dem. Na the same story every time – promise of change, then back to square one. Yet, in all this, faith dey anchor us. Like Peter walking on water, even when waves high, eyes on the master, we go make am. No be by power or travel visa, but by grace.

And ehn, talking about coexistence, this talk from our Lagos boss, Sanwo-Olu, on how Nigeria dey challenged to live together. Him yarn say e no easy, especially with different groups rubbing minds. True talk, from North to South, we dey try, but sometimes e feel like forcing oil and water to mix in one pot. Igbos for Lagos, Yorubas everywhere, Hausas trading – na beautiful mess, but with plenty friction. Him call am challenged, but me I call am adventure. Imagine if we no get this mix, life go dull like fufu without soup. And the complaints about projects favoring one area? E dey fly around like mosquito at night. Is the president ruling whole country or just him backyard? Na question wey dey beg answer, but instead of fight, make we laugh am off. Bible teach unity in diversity, like body parts working together – hand no fit vex say leg dey chop more food. If we grab that, our coexistence go turn testimony.

One more thing wey dey tickle me – this NNPC and that big refinery people dey talk to extend deal for crude supply with naira. No more dollar wahala, just local currency. E sound good on paper, like promising jollof without onion price hike. But you know how these deals go – start sweet, then twist like anaconda. If e work, e go save us foreign exchange stress, make fuel flow like river Jordan. But if e flop, na back to queuing for black market. Nigerians don tire for promise, but hope dey, especially with faith wey no shake. Even IMF dey advise, but our reply be say, two years too short to fix deep-rooted issues. True, rome no build in day, and Nigeria no be exception. We dey take am step by step, praying for wisdom like Solomon.

Finally, this northern governor wey dey eye 2027, him talk say possibility of leaving APC for Atiku side. E be like pre-season transfer in football, scouting options before whistle blow. Top man for North, him dey weigh chances, maybe tired of current team. But e go cause ripples, like stone for pond. Fans go divide, some dey shout loyalty, others opportunity. Wetin e mean for us? More drama, more alliances shifting like sand dunes. But in the end, voters go decide, and if we wise, we go choose based on track record, not sweet talk. And remember, kings rise and fall, but the kingdom of God endures. So, while politicians dey plot, make we focus on what lasts – family, faith, and that small hustle wey pay bills.

You see, in all this political circus, we Nigerians dey resilient, turning lemons to zobo drink. Even when threats come from afar or switches happen at home, we dey stand tall, laughing through the storm. Because at the end, na God wey dey direct the script, and Him punchline always perfect.
