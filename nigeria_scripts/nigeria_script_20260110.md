Eh, my people, wetin dey happen for this our country sef? You see this Trump man wey dey over there for America, him don wake up one morning and decide say na Nigeria him go threaten with military action. As in, brother, you get your own wahala with walls and tweets, now you wan come add pepper to our stew? I hear say our president Tinubu summon all those foreign diplomats for Abuja, like say una dey prepare to form alliance against Yankee invasion. But wait o, if Trump send soldiers, wetin dem go do? March through the traffic jam for Third Mainland Bridge? Dem go tire before dem reach Aso Rock. And me, I go just sit down with my garri and groundnut, watching dem sweat under this hot sun, thinking, welcome to Naija, where even war dey follow our time.

That one no even funny pass the way our Bayelsa governor just dump PDP like yesterday's fufu and run go APC. Chai, this politics na like those old Nollywood movies where the hero switch sides faster than you change channel when NEPA bring light back. One day him dey red, next day him wear yellow cap, smiling like say nothing happen. Shey you no see how politicians dey do? Dem promise heaven and earth, but na only earth dem dey chop. Me, I dey wonder, if all these governors keep jumping party like frog for rainy season, when dem go jump to fix road or hospital? Abi na only for election season dem get energy? But e get one thing wey dey console me: even when man dey change color like chameleon, God's word no dey change. Him say in Proverbs, a man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps. So maybe this governor steps go direct am back to sense one day, who knows?

Now, let me yarn una about this Sanwo-Olu wey dey Lagos, him don dey appeal to global investors for some climate change summit. As in, oga, you wan attract money to fight flood, but last time rain fall, everywhere turn to river Nile. People dey paddle canoe go market, buy fish wey dey swim pass dem. And him dey talk international climate change, meanwhile for our side, na local climate wey dey hot like pepper soup without water. I imagine those investors sitting down, listening to am, thinking, this man serious? Una get potholes wey swallow tire, and una dey worry about global warming? But e sweet me say at least him dey try, unlike some wey just dey sleep for office. And you know, in the Bible, dem talk about stewardship, how we suppose take care of the earth God give us. So maybe Sanwo-Olu go read Genesis one day and see say na our duty to keep things green, not just chop the green.

Speaking of chopping, you hear say Tinubu congratulate that old military president Babangida on him 84th birthday? Eh, IBB, the man wey open bank account for every citizen back in the day, now him dey collect birthday wishes like say na him still dey rule. President dey send message, saying happy birthday, you still dey sharp. Sharp? Oga, at 84, if you no dey sharp, na which part you go dey? But seriously, this one remind me of how our elders dey carry on, full of stories and wisdom, while the young ones dey hustle for survival. Me, I dey think, if Babangida fit live to 84 with all him wahala, then we too fit survive this economy. And e get grace for that, like Paul talk in Ephesians, God's power working in us to do more than we imagine. So maybe instead of military threats from outside, we go use that inner power to fix our own house.

Ah, and this doctors' strike wey government wan end, na another level of drama. Resident doctors dey fold arm, say no pay, no work, and patients dey queue like say na Black Friday for hospital. Government dey move to settle, but e too late, people don turn to herbalist and pastor for healing. I laugh because last week, my neighbor go church for prayer, come back say him malaria don heal by faith. But wetin if na surgery? You go tell surgeon say make him pray first before cut? This na the kind wahala wey make me believe say only divine intervention fit sort Nigeria. Like in James, dem say the prayer of the righteous avails much, so maybe if all these politicians kneel down well well, things go change.

Now, imagine this: Trump threat dey fly from America, diplomats dey gather like town hall meeting, and here we dey, ordinary citizens, still dey wake up to find say price of yam don increase again. As in, military action or no, hunger no dey respect uniform. I dey picture soldiers landing, only to join queue for bread, asking, bros, how much for one wrap? And our president, him dey respond say una dey engage diplomatically. Diplomatic? Oga, send garri as peace offering, make dem taste Naija hospitality. But e no funny pass how we Nigerians dey adapt. Flood come, we build canoe. Doctor strike, we find baba in village. Threat from abroad, we pray and hustle harder. That's our spirit, unkillable like cockroach.

Let me tell una small story. Last month, I dey travel from Port Harcourt to Enugu, bus break down for middle of nowhere, driver say na engine wahala. Everybody descend, start pushing, singing gospel songs to encourage. One aunty even say, this na test from God, like Job. By the time we push am start, na like miracle. See, even for small small thing, faith dey carry us. So for this big big politics, maybe na the same. Tinubu go meet World Bank chiefs, talk investment, but without prayer, na just talk. And for that Anambra election wey APC hail am for neutrality, neutrality good, but action better. Shey una understand?

Eh, and this NNPC with Dangote refinery, dem dey talk extend deal for crude supply with naira. As in, finally, something local to fix our oil mess? But wait, naira wey dey dance like azonto, how e go stable? I dey fear say tomorrow, dem go say deal don change because dollar jump. This na classic Naija, promise plenty, deliver small. But e inspire me, because in the end, like David against Goliath, small naira fit slay big dollar if we believe. God's economy no dey crash.

My people, from Bayelsa switch to Lagos appeal, from birthday wishes to strike settlement, our country na comedy show wey God dey direct. Politicians dey act, we dey laugh and pray, hoping for better ending. And if Trump still wan try, tell am say here, we get juju wey stronger than bomb – it's called resilience and grace. So make una hold body, because tomorrow go better, by God's power.
