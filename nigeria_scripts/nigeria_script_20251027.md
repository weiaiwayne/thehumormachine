E get one matter wey dey scatter my head these days, especially with this President Tinubu traveling all over the place, shaking hands with world leaders like him dey campaign for Miss World. You see am? Him go France meet Macron, next thing you know, him dey plan trip to Japan and Brazil. Me I dey think, if this man no tire from jet lag, who go? Imagine the wahala if him phone battery die mid-flight and him no fit call back home. But seriously, these international visits, dem dey promise big investments, like that eight billion dollars for energy wey dem secure. Eight billion! That kind money fit buy every generator for the whole country and still have change to fix the roads wey potholes dey swallow tires like groundnut.

Now, shift gear small, talk about this Senate President Akpabio and the drama wey him dey cause. The man actions dey spark fire everywhere, people dey talk say him dey play politics like chess master, but sometimes e be like him dey knock down the entire board. Controversy follow am like shadow for harmattan season. I hear say some people dey question if him dey represent everybody or just select few. Shey you understand? In our setup, leaders suppose bridge gaps, but e be like some gaps dey widen pass Atlantic Ocean. And with the APC issuing threats over that Governor Fubara matter, uncertainty dey hang for air thick like smoke from bush burning. Return or no return, the whole thing dey smell like old stew wey dem reheat too many times. Politicians dey promise stability, yet e be like dem dey add more pepper to the pot.

Let me yarn you something from the other side, this Peter Obi wey APC slam because of him statement on internet fraudsters. The man dey defend dem? Chai, that one na hot topic. Fraudsters, those yahoo boys wey dey turn laptop to magic wand, promising quick riches but delivering headache instead. Obi talk say dem need second chance or something, and APC jump on am like hawk on chicken. Me I no be judge o, but e make sense to laugh at the irony. We get leaders wey suppose fight crime, yet the economy tight pass belt after Christmas, pushing youth to desperate corners. Unemployment dey bite hard, families dey struggle to put food for table, and suddenly, one clever boy with phone fit change everything. But wetin go happen if dem all turn legit? Who go dey do those advance fee scams wey make Hollywood movie? Na our own original 419 wey export go world.

Speaking on youth and talent, I see this incredible kid from the streets, doing things wey blow mind. Extraordinary teen, dey inspire everybody. In a place where opportunity scarce like water for dry season, this one dey shine bright. Reminds me of how we Nigerians get gift inside, even when system no favor. And that drummer wey confess say life no easy, pounding beats while heart heavy with the condition wey we face daily. The Nigerian condition, e be like marathon race wey no finish line, full of sweat and occasional victory lap. But e sweet when you see one person break through, like that Lagos kid wey dey amaze with skills. No be juju, na pure hustle mixed with talent God deposit.

Now, enter the energy side, with NNPC and that refinery in talks to extend deal on crude supply using local currency. Sounds good on paper, right? Keep money circulating inside, reduce dollar wahala. But you know how these things go, promise plenty, delivery dey crawl like snail for rain. Investments coming, eight billion strong, yet light still flicker like candle for wind. Imagine investor come, see the setup, and ask, where the power to run this big machine? We go tell am, hold on, generator go soon hum. And the French connection with Macron, dem dey talk partnership, but partnership na two-way street. If France bring tech, we suppose bring the vibe, the resilience wey make us survive anything.

Pause for second, think about coexistence, like what that Sanwo-Olu yarn about challenged living together. In our space, tribes mix, religions blend, but tension dey bubble under. Igbos for certain areas feel sidelined, projects dey favor some spots more than others. Alleged lopsidedness, people dey whisper say leadership partial, serving few over masses. Is it for the whole or just one corner? E dey pain when you see inequality stare you for face, like market woman wey price hike every day. But here's the grace part, in all this mess, faith keep us going. Even when deals delay and threats fly, there's that quiet strength from above, whispering say redemption come if we hold on. Politicians may chop and chop, but divine justice no dey sleep.

And unemployment, what dem dey do to tackle am? USA get their plans, our side reply IMF say fixing no be two years work. Realistic talk, but youth dey wait now, not tomorrow. Families pressure mount, papa expect son to bring salary, mama pray for breakthrough. I remember one time, friend graduate with first class, yet him dey hawk pure water for street corner. Laughable? No, heartbreaking. But we turn am to joke, say at least him fit network with customers. That's our spirit, find humor in hardship, turn tear to chuckle.

Travel too, somebody ask how to move from capital to northern city without plane. Tourist wahala, wanting adventure on road. But road journey na own comedy, buses packed like sardine, driver speeding past checkpoints, praying no accident. From Abuja to Kano, e be epic tale of dust, stops, and small chops wey no satisfy. Better fly, but if no, prepare mind for the unexpected, like sudden rain or police stop wey turn to negotiation.

Finally, ranking foods, that one na endless debate. Swallow versus rice, egusi over vegetable. But in this economy, even food choice dey limited. We rank am based on what belly fit handle without complain. And helping Nigerian Christians, question dey fly, how to support? Faith communities strong, but persecution dey lurk. Answer simple, pray, give, stand firm. Like the Bible talk, love neighbor, even when neighbor dey vex.

Crazy things happening, funny but true. From political threats to refinery deals, youth rising to leaders traveling, e be mix of hope and hustle. But through it all, we laugh, we pray, we push forward. Because if we no laugh, the wahala go swallow us whole. And that, my friends, na the real punch â€“ life's too short for straight face in the face of absurdity.
