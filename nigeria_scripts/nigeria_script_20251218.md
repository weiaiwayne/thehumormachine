Wetin dey happen for this world sef, my people? Imagine one big man from across the ocean, the one dem call Trump, waking up one morning and deciding say him go threaten to send troops come scatter our own side. E be like say him watch too much Nollywood action film and now think say we dey act sequel to some invasion movie. Him talk say military action, as if say our matter concern am pass him own backyard barbecue. And our leaders? Dem summon all those foreign envoys come Abuja, like say na emergency family meeting to discuss who go pay for the jollof rice. But wait, Trump don even respond, assuring say him government dey handle am diplomatically. Diplomatically? Abeg, if na me, I for just send am one plate of pounded yam with egusi soup, make him understand say war no dey sweet for empty belle.

You see this kind wahala, e remind me of how we dey always manage international drama with local charm. But let's shift gear small, talk about those resident doctors wey don strike again. E be like say every time dem fold arm, na then hospital turn to ghost town, and patient go begin pray say make God turn water to medicine sharp sharp. Government dey move to end the strike, but e take time pass Moses parting the Red Sea. Imagine, you dey bed with fever, doctor no dey, nurse dey run helter-skelter, and all you fit do na to whisper Psalm 23 under your breath, hoping say the Lord go be your personal physician. Shey you sabi that feeling? When wahala dey hot, we turn straight to faith, cos human hand no fit fix everything. And these doctors, dem deserve better – no be play play to save life when your own salary dey fight for survival.

Speaking of survival, make I yarn una about this climate change matter wey our Lagos State helmsman, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, dey make appeal to global investors. Him stand there, making renewed call on Thursday, as if say investors go hear am and rush come with their billions to fix the flood wey dey turn streets to river Nile every rainy season. E sweet die, abi? Him talk say Lagos State International Climate Change, but meanwhile, for market, trader dey bail water from shop with bucket, cursing the rain like say na personal enemy. And we? We dey adapt with our usual Naija ingenuity – one man go invent floating danfo bus, another go sell umbrella with built-in generator for power outage. But seriously, in all this environmental madness, e good to remember that creation story for Bible, where God put everything in balance. If politicians no fit, at least grace dey cover the shortfall, turning flood to baptism of sorts.

That bring me to another angle – this whole talk of coexistence and unity wey dey trend, especially with voices from the East saying one nation na mere illusion. E be like say Igbos for Lagos dey feel like guests in their own home, with projects tilting one way pass the other. Alleged lopsidedness, dem call am, questioning if the top man na president for all or just for select spots. My people, e pain me to see division dey brew when we suppose be family under one roof. Remember that parable of the prodigal son? Even when brother return, father welcome am with open arms. But here, e be like politicians dey play favoritism game, sharing locust portion instead of equal slice. And we the masses? We dey hustle cross ethnic lines, sharing garri in traffic or swapping stories at bus stop. Shey no be that the real unity? Faith teach us to love neighbor as self, no matter the tribe, cos at the end, we all dey face the same sun and same NEPA darkness.

Now, let's not forget the unemployment front, where the big question dey hang: wetin the powers that be, from Yankee side to our own, dey do to tackle joblessness? Dem talk say USA government versus ours, comparing notes like say na football match. But truth be say, for here, graduate dey hawk pure water, engineer dey drive okada, and artist dey beg for gig at owambe party. E frustrating, eh? One time, I see young chap with degree for hand, CV long pass Bible, yet him dey queue for 50k job wey no even pay light bill. And IMF? Dem reply say fixing our issues in two years na unrealistic dream. No wahala, cos Bible talk say with God, all things possible, even in economy wey dey shake like earthquake. So while leaders dey chat with World Bank chiefs or depart for Japan and Brazil trips, we dey pray for breakthrough, turning CV to prayer points. Imagine if dem add faith to policy – unemployment go drop faster than iPhone price after launch.

Ehn, and this Bayelsa matter, where the state head switch from PDP to APC like say na fashion trend. One day red, next day broom sweeping clean. E make sense? Politics turn to musical chairs, with loyalty shifting quicker than Lagos rain. But in the mix, former military president Babangida clock 84, and top man congratulate am, hailing wisdom and service. At 84, e be milestone, reminding us say life no be just power play, but enduring like that old palm wine tree. Tinubu hail neutrality in some Anambra affair too, staying above fray like referee in neutral kit. But me, I think say in all this political tango, the real neutrality na when you trust divine plan over human scheme. Cos politicians promise moon and stars, but only heaven fit deliver without fine print.

You know, weaving through all these headlines, from diplomatic summons over Yankee threats to doctor walkouts and investor pleas, e clear say our story full of twists. Yet, in the absurdity, we find reason to laugh and lean on something steady. That NNPC and refinery talk about extending naira deal? E sound promising, but who knows if e go hold water pass paper promise. And those extraordinary teen stories or drummer confessions? Dem show say talent dey bubble under surface, waiting for chance to shine. Even when system fail, individual spirit rise, fueled by grace that no strike or threat fit dim. So next time Trump talk bomb, or flood swallow road, or job hunt turn marathon, remember: we no dey alone. The one wey calm storm dey watch, turning wahala to testimony. And if na so, then make we continue this hustle with smile, cos laughter na best weapon against the chaos. After all, if God fit part sea, him fit part traffic too – or at least give us grace to danfo-dance through it.
