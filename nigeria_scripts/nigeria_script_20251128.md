Eh, my people, picture this chaos wey dey go down with our leaders and these oyinbo big shots. You hear say President Tinubu don summon every foreign diplomat inside Abuja, wetin be this now? Na like say na emergency family meeting we dey call, complete with jollof rice and small chops, all because one American oga, Trump, open mouth waka threaten say him go send military come scatter our side. Me I ask myself, wetin we do to deserve this kind wahala? We no dey steal their jobs or kidnap their celebrities, abi? Na just our normal hustle, surviving with pure water and pure determination.

Now, imagine those diplomats arriving, suits pressed, ties choking dem neck, sitting down for that long table, sweating under AC wey dey fight to stay on. Tinubu enter, calm as Sunday morning prayer, tell dem say no shaking, we dey handle am diplomatically. Diplomatic? That word alone suppose make person laugh. In Naija style, diplomatic mean we go send email, follow with WhatsApp voice note, then maybe bribe with one crate of Star beer if e no work. But Trump? That man no dey do half measures. Him dey tweet from golf course, talking military action like say Naija be him personal gym. I dey wonder, which part of Naija him wan attack first? The part where we dey queue for ATM wey no get money, or the market where price dey change faster than chameleon skin?

Shifting gears to this Bayelsa matter, you see how that governor there dump PDP like old wrapper, jump straight to APC camp? Na so e be, people dey switch parties faster than channel on decoder wey no dey pay subscription. One day na opposition, next day na ruling party, carrying their bags full of promises and empty pockets. Me I no blame am sha, politics na business, and business na survival. If PDP no dey pay salary on time, why no cross over where dem dey share rice sacks at Christmas? But wait, e get one thing wey funny pass: all these defections dey happen as if na Black Friday sale for political market. Everybody rushing to grab the best deal before e finish. And the followers? Dem just dey follow like sheep to pasture, hoping say the grass go greener on the other side. But in Naija, grass no dey green, na just illusion from hunger.

Speaking of old soldiers and new dramas, Tinubu don send congrats to General Babangida on him 84th birthday. IBB, the man wey used to rule with iron fist, now dey collect birthday wishes like grandpa receiving envelopes at family reunion. Tinubu write say him dey celebrate the legacy, the wisdom, all that good-good. Legacy? Ah, depending on who you ask, that word mean different things. For some, na the bridges and roads; for others, na the annulled elections wey still dey haunt us till tomorrow. But 84 years? That na achievement in itself, especially for ex-military man wey survive coups and counter-coups. Me I imagine Babangida reading that message, smiling, thinking, "This boy Tinubu still remembers who used to sign the cheques back then." And Tinubu? Him dey play the long game, congratulating elders to remind everybody say history no forget, e just dey wait for the right moment to remix am.

Now, let's talk this U-turn on that 15 percent fuel import tariff. Government announce am one day, next day dem retract like bad gen that trips off during power surge. Why? Pressure from importers wey no wan pay extra, or maybe calculation error from some economist wey use calculator wey battery don die. In Naija, policy na like weather forecast – sunny in the morning, rain by afternoon, no umbrella in sight. Importers happy now, but consumers? We still dey pay through nose at pump. E be like say dem dey test our patience, see how much we fit endure before we start to murmur like Israelites in the wilderness. And that wilderness feeling? E real. Prices climbing, wallets empty, yet we dey pray for manna from heaven, or at least subsidy wey no vanish like morning dew.

Ah, and the resident doctors strike? Government finally move to end am, after months of bed dey empty in hospitals. Doctors fold arms, patients dey suffer, and now dem dey negotiate like market women haggling over tomato price. One side want better pay, other side dey promise heaven and earth, but deliver only promissory notes. I dey feel for those doctors sha, studying for years, facing Nigerian roads to work, only to strike because salary no match the stress. E remind me of that Bible story where workers in vineyard complain say dem no get fair wage – same vibe here, but instead of coins, na naira wey dey depreciate daily. If government fit settle quick, maybe we go get peace, and patients no go resort to babalawo or herbalist when fever catch dem. But knowing our system, negotiation go drag like Lagos go-slow, with everybody horn blowing but no movement.

You know, weaving through all this noise, e easy to lose hope, but then I remember how faith dey shine even in dark times. Like when that prodigal son return home, father no ask questions, just open arms wide. Our leaders suppose learn from that – forgive, restore, build up instead of tearing down. Or think of David facing Goliath with just sling and stone; Naija youth dey do same, slinging ideas against giant problems. No be by power or might, but by spirit, as dem talk in scriptures. So even as Trump dey bark, or parties dey shuffle, we hold on to that grace wey never fail, turning wahala into testimony one day at a time.

That Dangote refinery and NNPC deal extension? Dem dey talk naira-based crude supply, trying to keep dollars out and local money in. Sounds smart on paper, like buying fuel with cowries instead of foreign coins. But in practice? Refinery dey hum, but does e reach the common man without middlemen adding their cut? NNPC promising extension, Dangote nodding along, yet streets still dey flood with smuggled fuel from borders. E be like family business where uncles dey share profits, but nephews outside gate dey beg for crumbs. If e work, na win for economy; if not, na another round of queues and black market blues. Me I dey watch, praying say this time, the oil no go leak into politics as usual.

And don't get me started on that World Bank meeting in Abuja. Tinubu sit down with their chiefs, discussing loans and reforms like old friends catching up over tea. World Bank dey drop advice on fixing economy, but wey una think? Naija no be lab experiment; we get our own juju for surviving. Them say cut spending, raise taxes – easy to talk when your salary dey dollars. Tinubu listen, nod, then go do wetin fit our reality. E remind me of Proverbs, where wise king seek counsel but follow heart guided by higher power. Hope say from that meeting, something good come out, like jobs for youth or stable prices for mama-put sellers.

One more angle: this Igbos in Lagos talk, where some say one Nigeria na mirage. Tensions high, projects looking lopsided, like say some states dey chop more than others. Tinubu accused of favoring home base, but him defend say na national plan. Mirage? Maybe, or perhaps oasis if we all drink from same well. In church, we sing of unity in diversity, tribes and tongues joining in harmony. Politicians fit learn, stop the division game and build bridges instead of walls. Because at end of day, hunger no know tribe, and light bill no ask for ethnic card.

Finally, that Sanwo-Olu speech on Nigeria's challenged coexistence – Lagos as most dangerous state? Him dey paint picture of struggles, but solutions? Thin air. Dangerous? Tell that to okada rider dodging potholes or trader facing task force raids. Yet, in all, we push on, faith as anchor. Like Paul say, we run race with endurance, eyes on prize. So whether diplomats come or threats fly, we stand firm, laughing through the storm, because joy from above no dey depend on headlines. And if Trump still wan try, make him come see how we turn threats into triumphs – Naija style, with prayer and plenty palm wine.
