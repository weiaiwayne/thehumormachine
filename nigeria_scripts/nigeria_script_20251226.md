Eh, make I yarn una small about this matter wey dey scatter head for this side, especially with how things dey turn upside down with big oga from America talking tough. You see, Donald Trump, that man wey get mouth like empty barrel, wake up one day and decide say e go threaten to send soldiers come here because of some wahala wey nobody even understand fully. And wetin our side do? Dem summon all those foreign big shots to Abuja, like say na town hall meeting for village square. Imagine, all those diplomats siddon, sipping tea, while tension dey high like keke wey overload for Third Mainland. Shey you fit picture am? One side dey flex muscle from Washington, the other dey respond with diplomatic handshakes, assuring say everything na talk. But me, I dey ask, wetin be the real gist? Na because of oil or because Trump wan come taste real pepper soup and no fit handle the heat? Abi na just him way of saying hello to old friends?

That one alone no finish. Now, add this twist with Babangida, the former military oga at the top, turning 84, and Tinubu send him birthday wishes like say dem dey plan family reunion. IBB, the man wey used to run things with iron fist back in the days, now dey collect congratulations like grandpa wey just win bingo. E sweet me sha, because in this land wey history dey repeat like scratched CD, e good to see old timers still dey get love. But wait, make una think: if Babangida fit reach 84 after all those coup stories and announcement for radio at 5am, then maybe we all get chance to blow candles without fear of sudden blackout. And talking about light, even when the power company dey play hide and seek, the grace wey dey from above never take holiday. E dey shine steady, reminding us say no matter how the plot twist, redemption dey wait for the corner.

Now, shift gear small to this Bayelsa matter, where the head of that riverine place suddenly jump ship from PDP to APC, like fisherman wey see better net on the other boat. One minute him dey wave red flag, next thing e dey wear broom like say na new fashion trend. E no surprise me though, because in our political game, loyalty be like market woman bargaining price – e change with the season. You know how e be, especially when the wind dey blow from Aso Rock direction. But the question wey dey my mind na, wetin this switch mean for the small people wey dey suffer everyday? Dem go get better roads now, or na just another round of promises wey go fade like yesterday's headline? Me, I dey laugh because if politicians fit change color like chameleon for survival, then we ordinary citizens sef fit learn that trick for job hunting. Imagine resume wey dey adapt to whatever company dey interview – today na banker, tomorrow na tech guru. But seriously, in the midst of this musical chairs, e good to hold onto that biblical wisdom say faithfulness to what matters most go bring the real breakthrough, no be party jumping.

And e no stop there. This whole talk about inheriting mess from previous administration, with Oshiomhole coming out to say the economy was already in tatters when the handoff happen. Like say na relay race where the previous runner drop the baton in mud. Shambles everywhere, prices climbing higher than climbers on Idanre Hills, and unemployment staring us in the face like uninvited guest at owambe party. Young people dey graduate with degrees wey no fit buy even one bag of rice, and the big men dey point fingers like kids fighting over last sweet. What the international bodies like World Bank dey advise? Meet in Abuja, talk big about fixes, but when e reach ground zero, na still the same hustle. I remember one time, my cousin apply for job, send CV to everywhere, even to those foreign firms wey promise heaven. Wetin him get? Email say "we'll get back to you" – three years now, no call. Shey na joke? But here's the beauty: even in this economic squeeze, there's this quiet strength from faith wey say grace sufficient, turning water to wine, or in our case, turning scarcity to testimony. Politicians may fumble the ball, but the higher power no dey miss shots.

Speaking of international vibes, see this one with Sanwo-Olu trying to charm global investors at some climate change summit. The man dey appeal like salesman for Alaba market, promising green opportunities and all. Lagos, with its flood-prone streets and endless gridlock, now positioning as eco-friendly hub? E funny me die, because last time rain fall, the whole place turn to Venice, but with danfo boats instead of gondolas. Investors siddon listen, probably thinking, "This na the same city wey potholes swallow tires whole?" But credit to him for trying, in a country where every pitch sound like 419 scheme until proven otherwise. And tying back to that Trump noise, with diplomats rushing about, e make you wonder if all this global posturing go actually bring investment or just more headlines. Me, I dey hope say from this wahala, something good emerge – maybe jobs, maybe stability, or at least better power supply so we no go dey rely on generators wey drink fuel like beer at beer parlour.

Now, let's not forget the doctors, those heroes in white wey finally call off their strike after what feel like eternity. The negotiation table turn from war zone to peace accord, and patients dey breathe small relief. But think am: while dem dey strike, hospitals empty like ghost town, and people dey resort to herbalist or prayer warrior. No be say faith no work, e dey work wonders, but sometimes you need the syringe too. This resolution sweet, but e remind us how fragile the system be – one push, and e collapse like bad bridge. In Bayelsa or anywhere, when even medical people dey fight for rights, you know the foundation dey shake. Yet, in the Nigerian spirit, we dey find humor: doctors on strike mean more time for Nollywood on phone, or family dey turn home to clinic with paracetamol and hot water. And through it all, that subtle reminder from scriptures say healing come from above, but we must do our part to keep the lights on in the wards.

Wrapping this up with one last thought on how IBB's birthday fit symbolize hope. At 84, the man dey celebrated, showing say even after storms of power grabs and economic dips, life go on with grace intact. In our daily grind – from dodging traffic to chasing elusive opportunities – e dey encourage say no matter the threats from afar or switches at home, there's a bigger story wey end well. So, next time Trump or anybody wan play tough, make dem know say here, we no dey fear; we dey laugh, we dey pray, and we dey bounce back stronger. After all, only one redeemer fit turn threats into triumphs without breaking sweat – and him no need army or party to do am.
