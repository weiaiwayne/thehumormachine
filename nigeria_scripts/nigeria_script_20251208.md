Eh, make una picture this one: Bayelsa governor, the man wey suppose dey loyal like dog to PDP, suddenly jump ship and land for APC side, like say na wetin dey hot now. I mean, e be like say politics na fashion show, one day you dey wear red, next day you switch to broom wey dem dey sweep everywhere. Shey na because election dey come or na just say him see say the grass greener for other side? Me, I think say na the same old dance wey dem dey do, changing parties like we change SIM cards when airtime don finish. But wait o, if everybody dey jump like this, who go stay put? Na only the voters dem, wey dey suffer the wahala after.

That one dey remind me of how Tinubu go ahead wish former military president Babangida happy 84th birthday. IBB, the guy wey don see plenty coup and come out smelling like rose water. President congratulate am, say na elder statesman, but e be like say na coded message: "Oga, you see as we dey manage this country? Your time no too bad pass." Imagine, 84 years, and him still dey there, advising from the shadows while we dey hustle for daily bread. Me, I dey think, if Babangida fit reach that age, maybe na because him know say life na like military parade – you march forward, but sometimes you halt and turn. And for us ordinary people, e be like say we dey march but the road na pothole everywhere. Thank God say him dey celebrate, at least e show say even generals fit turn old and soft, abi?

Now, talking about soft, wetin be this matter with Trump wey dey threaten military action against Naija? The man talk say him go send soldiers if things no straighten up, and our government summon all foreign diplomats for Abuja to clear the air. Tinubu respond say dem dey handle am diplomatically, no wahala. But e be like say na Nollywood script: American oga for big office dey shout, and we dey reply with "sir, make we talk am settle." I laugh because, e be as if Trump think say Nigeria na his backyard barbecue wey dey burn. Him no sabi say here, we don handle worse – from Boko to bandits, we still dey stand. But seriously, if America send soldiers, wetin dem go do? March for Lagos traffic? Or try collect bribe from okada riders? No be small thing o. And the way our leaders dey assure say everything na peace, e make me remember how we dey pray for divine intervention in times like this. Because, truly, only higher power fit calm such storm without turning am to bigger fire.

Shifting gear small, see this U-turn on that 15% fuel import tariff wey government announce then quick-quick cancel am. One day dem say na policy to save naira, next day dem say oya, make una forget. E be like say dem dey test water with toe, see if e hot, then pull back. Nigerians wey dey queue for fuel station no dey surprise again, because policy na like our weather – sunny one minute, rain the next. But the real joke na how dem think say we no go notice. We wey dey calculate every kobo for plate of garri, how we no go see when price flip like that? E dey pain, but e funny too, because if dem fit U-turn that fast on fuel, maybe dem fit U-turn on other wahala like doctors strike wey dem dey try end now. Resident doctors dey fold arms, hospitals empty, and government dey beg say make dem resume. Abi na because election season, or na say dem finally hear cry? I dey hope say na genuine, because health no be joke, and when doctor no dey, na God clinic we dey run go.

Speaking of deals that dey make sense, hear this one between NNPC and Dangote refinery – dem dey talk to extend that naira-based crude supply agreement. No more dollar wahala, just pure naira for oil. E sound good on paper, like say finally we dey cut the foreign chain wey dey choke economy. But wait, Dangote, the king of cement and now refinery, him go agree sharp-sharp? Or na another long negotiation wey go drag like Lagos go-slow? Me, I see am as win, because if refinery dey run on local money, maybe fuel price go drop small, and we no go dey beg for import again. Imagine, no more long queue under sun, just fill tank and zoom. But knowing Naija, something go still happen – maybe pipe burst or agreement change. Still, e dey give hope, like that biblical promise wey say provision go come from unexpected places. Who know, maybe this na the grace wey go flow like oil from that refinery.

Eh, but let me yarn una about this extraordinary Nigerian teen wey dey make waves. The gist dey everywhere, one small boy or girl wey don achieve something big, like inventing app or winning global contest. E inspire, because for land wey unemployment dey bite hard, seeing youth shine na like light in darkness. Government dey talk about tackling joblessness with USA help, but e be like say dem dey promise tomorrow while today dey hungry. What dem and IMF dey argue, say fixing problem no fit happen in two years? Abeg, we sabi that one already – Naija condition na marathon, no be sprint. But this teen, him or her story dey show say individual hustle fit break through. No be say politicians no try, but sometimes e be like say dem dey build castle for Lagos while other states dey beg for crumbs. Alleged lopsided projects, people dey murmur say Tinubu na Lagos president, but e be the same one Nigeria wey we all share the load.

Now, on that note of sharing, I hear say Igbos for Lagos dey talk say one Nigeria na mirage. Serious matter, but e funny how tension dey brew like egusi soup wey overcook. Sanwo-Olu dey talk about challenged coexistence, say Lagos na most dangerous state, yet people still flock there for opportunity. E be paradox, abi? We dey complain, but no dey leave. Like family wey dey quarrel but still chop one pot. And for the ranking of Nigerian foods, jollof go always win, but politics na the real bitter leaf wey no sweet. Even when wahala plenty, we find way laugh, because as e be, joy na our secret weapon.

Finally, picture President Tinubu meeting World Bank chiefs for Abuja, or departing for Japan and Brazil – international moves wey show say we dey play big boy game. But back home, Buhari come Lagos and Tinubu go hide? Old gist, but e paint picture of how power shift dey work. Dem dey reply IMF say unrealistic to fix quick, and I agree – healing Naija wound na like mending torn aso-oke, take time and care. Yet, in all this, we hold to that faith wey say redemption dey come, not from Washington or Abuja alone, but from above. Because if Trump threaten and we still dey here, na proof say our foundation strong. So, next time politician jump party or policy flip, just smile and say, "Na so e be," and keep pushing. After all, in God's plan, even refinery deal fit turn to blessing we no see coming.
