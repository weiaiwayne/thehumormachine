Oya, good evening my people! How una dey? Hope say the NEPA bring light today? Ehn? Some dey shout "Up NEPA!" like say na prayer point. If NEPA be church, Nigeria go don convert to darkness denomination by now.

So, I don land here today to talk small something about our oga dem. You know, the people wey dey "steering the ship of state," as dem dey call am. Steering ke? More like driving against traffic on a one-way road!

I see say dem dey yarn for Reddit about Tinubu. "Excellent politician, terrible leader," dem say. Hmmm. Na like saying Suya sweet, but e dey give you heart attack. Truth be say, e sabi the game, no doubt. But the game na football, and we need someone wey sabi fix the economy, not dribble am.

And Nairaland, ehn? Those people, dem no get chill. Straight to the point! Someone just vexing about everything. But I understand. Me sef, sometimes I look at our government, I dey wonder if dem dey use NaijaScript to code our policies. You know, that Pidgin English programming language. Because sometimes, the things wey dem dey do, e no get head, e no get tail! Like, you tell me you wan fight corruption, then you appoint people weyâ€¦ wait, wait, I no wan enter trouble o! Let me just cough small. *coughs loudly*

Speaking of coding, I see say NYSC still dey carry people go village wey road no dey. The journey of a lifetime, dem dey call am. More like the journey to another life, because you fit no return in one piece! I remember my own NYSC days. Dem post me to one village wey the only network wey dey work na MTN of 2005. I had to climb mango tree just to send text message. Climb tree! Me! I be Lagos boy! I nearly become monkey that year.

But the worst thing be say, after all the climbing and suffering, dem still pay us allowance wey no fit buy Indomie and egg for one week. Na wa o!

And that Pastor Jerry Eze of Zion ministry, the one wey people dey fear for their grandma. I no know wetin dey happen there o, but I just dey pray say my own grandma no get appointment with him. Because if grandma start speaking in tongues, I go know say something dey fishy.

But seriously, my people, sometimes I think we dey deserve all these things. We dey complain, but we no dey do anything. We just dey siddon dey look. Like say we dey watch Nollywood film wey we already know the ending. The ending na: suffering and smiling.

But, maybe, just maybe, things go change. Maybe one day, NEPA go give us constant light, our roads go good, and our leaders go start to lead with sense. Maybe, just maybe, NaijaScript go actually work, and our government go start to code policies wey make sense. But for now, make we just continue to pray, hustle, and manage. After all, na we be Nigerians! We sabi how to survive anything. Even bad governance!
