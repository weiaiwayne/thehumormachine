Oya, gather round, gather round! Make we yarn small before the NEPA people remember say light dey. You know how dem be. One minute bright, next minute… darkness! Just like our politicians, ehn?

So, I bin dey see some things online today. Reddit, Nairaland… the usual suspects. You know, the places where Nigerians go to shout into the void and hope someone, somewhere, is listening. Apparently, Reddit wan change some things for r/Nigeria. New moderators, stricter post titles… Ah, Nigerians and rules! That's like trying to teach a goat to drive a danfo. Good luck with that one!

And then I see this NaijaScript thing – programming in Pidgin! "If you ever struggle with programming tutorials..." Bros, everything in Nigeria is a struggle! You think Pidgin programming go solve am? Maybe if the error message dey read, "Oga, wetin you do so?" people go understand better. But me, I still prefer to just switch off the computer and go chop boli. Much less stressful.

But the real gist na the politics, ehn? Tinubu this, Tinubu that. Someone on Reddit dey hail him as “an excellent politician but a terrible leader.” Wait, what? So he good at the game, but the country dey suffer? That's like saying a barber is excellent at holding scissors, but always cuts your ear off! I no understand o!

And talking about cutting, the amount of corruption stories wey dey fly around ehn… my head dey spin! Na who never thief for this country? Even the ones wey dey shout "anti-corruption" loudest, na dem dey hide the biggest agbada of money for their village.

You know, I remember back in Unilag, we used to call one particular politician "Baba Slow Motion." Because everything he did, it took forever! Even to open a bottle of beer for him was a national crisis! And now, years later, I see say nothing has really changed. The same slow motion, the same plenty talk, the same… where is the light?

And Nairaland, ehn? Those people, their jokes dey sweet my belle! They know how to turn the bitter truth into something you can swallow with a cold Star. But some of them, ehn... their tribalism dey smell! Can't we just all agree that we're all suffering together and find a way out of this mess? Abi we wan continue to dey fight over crumbs while the big boys dey chop the whole cake?

And then I see this thread about "The Longest Journey of My Life on Nigerian Road" because of NYSC. Ah, NYSC! That’s a story for another day. Let's just say I spent my service year learning how to dodge potholes and fight mosquitoes. A true Nigerian survival course! More practical than any textbook, I tell you!

But seriously, ehn, we need to hold these people accountable. We need to demand better. We need to… hey, wait a minute… is that the sound of NEPA? *Sound of lights flickering and going out*. Ah, I talk am! I talk am! See, even the light dey run away from this wahala! Okay, make we continue this conversation tomorrow. If NEPA allows it. Oya, good night everybody! And remember to buy fuel for your generator! You go need am!
