E get one thing wey dey make me wonder about dis our country sometimes, especially with all dis talk about leaders visiting each other like say na Christmas party. You see, dis Governor Soludo don show face for Aso Rock to see di big oga, and everybody dey hail am like e don score goal for World Cup. But wait, shey na just for photo op or wetin? Because if e be say dem dey plan how to fix road wey dey swallow cars for rainy season, den I go believe say e worth di fuel wey dem burn go reach there. Otherwise, na just another episode of dat endless soap opera wey we call politics here.

Now, speaking of soap opera, I read dis open letter to di President, full of advice like say e be exam question. Di writer dey yarn about how to make things better, from economy to security, and I dey nod my head like say I understand. But truth be say, if politicians go read all di letters wey people dey write, dem go need extra brain to process am. Imagine, one day e go be like, "Oga, your excellency, please fix di potholes before my okada tire burst," and next day, "Sir, why dis inflation dey chop my salary like termite?" Shey dem no tire? And me sef, as person wey grow up for street, I know say advice plenty, but action scarce like pure water for harmattan.

Dat one dey remind me of dis by-election wey just happen, where di APC dey claim say na endorsement for di whole administration. Massive win, dem call am, like say dem score hat-trick. But e be like, wetin endorsement mean if di people still dey struggle to buy garri? You win seats, good, but if di winners no go back to diir constituencies to fix school roof wey dey leak like sieve, den na just numbers on paper. I dey imagine di voters now, dem dey clap for di win, but inside mind, dem dey think, "Congrats o, but when una go bring dat water project wey una promise since 2023?" Na so life be here, celebration outside, wahala inside.

You know, di comparison between how America dey tackle joblessness and how we dey do am here, e dey make me laugh in Pidgin. Over there, dem get programs, training, even apps to match you with work like Tinder for jobs. Here, na "Go hustle" or "Enter danfo, maybe you go see something." Di government dey try, but e be like dem dey run race with one leg tied. Unemployment dey high, youth dey plenty, yet every corner you turn, na yahoo boy or area boy you see turning skills into survival mode. And me, I no blame dem; if school no teach you coding but teach you how to cram for WAEC, wetin you go do? But e sweet to think say, with little faith, like dat small mustard seed wey Jesus talk about, even one good policy fit grow into forest of opportunities. No be magic, but hope wey no die.

Ah, and dis talk about why di President special, e dey everywhere like juju rumor. Some people dey say e get special sauce, others dey yarn say na from him time as governor for Lagos wey e learn di tricks. Achievements plenty, dem list am: roads, markets, security even. But wait o, as governor then, e do well, true, but now as number one, shey di specialness dey spread nationwide or e still dey concentrate for one area? I dey picture am like dat one rich uncle wey build big house for village, but di rest of di family still dey sleep under mango tree. Special yes, but make e rub on all of us na. And funny thing, in di Bible, dem call Jesus di special one because e no just talk, e deliver. So if our leaders wan be special like dat, dem go need to do more dan visit and promise; dem go need to show di grace in action, abi?

Now, let me yarn una about dis heaven of corruption matter wey people dey call Nigeria sometimes. No be say everywhere clean, but e be like our own kind of paradise where everybody get chance to chop, even if na small small. Di headlines dey scream am, but on ground, na di small man dey feel di heat most. You go market to buy yam, price don jump like athlete, and you dey ask, "Wetin happen?" Seller go say, "Na di wahala from top." But if corruption be heaven, den why we no dey enjoy di milk and honey? Instead, na sweat and hustle. Me sef, I dey pray say God go touch di hearts of dose in charge, make dem remember say true wealth na when everybody get plate, not just few people get buffet. E no easy, but with redemption like di prodigal son story, even wayward system fit turn around.

Dat brings me to di CIA agent talk, wey dey fly around like bat rumor for night. People dey whisper say di President na agent, planted to shake things up. Haba, if na true, den which mission be dis? To make fuel price rise or to make naira dance samba? Because spy movie no get dis kind plot. James Bond go blow up villain base, but here, na inflation wey blow up our pockets. And if e be CIA, den America suppose send better script, one wey get happy ending. But seriously, all dis conspiracy dey distract from real talk: how to build economy wey work for all. I dey laugh because, in di end, no matter who pull strings, it's God wey hold di ultimate remote. So make we focus on dat grace wey never fail, even when plans scatter.

One more thing, dis unemployment wahala, comparing USA and Naija, e show say we get potential but execution dey lag. Dem over there get stimulus checks, here na "Manage" checks from relatives. Youths dey graduate with degrees, but jobs dey hide like Easter egg. I know one guy, bright boy, study engineering, now e dey drive Uber because "engineer" no mean automatic work. And di government dey say dem dey tackle am, but e be like tackling giant with toothpick. Shey you understand? But hope dey, like di psalm wey say di Lord no sleep nor slumber over His people. So even if policy slow, faith go bridge di gap till better days come.

Finally, all dis political drama, from visits to letters to wins, e dey like Nollywood film wey no end. But in di midst, we Nigerians dey find way to laugh and pray. Because if no be so, who go survive? So next time you hear big news, remember: e go better, by God's doing. And dat na di real special part.
