Ah, my people, make una hear this one. So, Governor Soludo don go visit the big man for Aso Rock, abi? E sweet die, like say na family reunion for state house governors. But wait o, Soludo wey dey Anambra, him sef dey try fix road and all, but as e enter Abuja, na so e turn to like pilgrim wey dey find holy water. Wetin dey happen? Dem dey share blueprint for how to make naira strong or just chop jollof together? Me I no know, but one thing sure, after that visit, Anambra go get new borehole or something, shey you understand?

Now, talking about this wahala wey dey call corruption, dem say Naija be heaven for it. Heaven? Chai, if na heaven, why e no get pearly gates with AC? Instead, na potholes and bribe everywhere. Politicians dey build mansions from our taxes, while we dey manage with okada for rain. Imagine, you dey queue for fuel, sweating like say na marathon, and dem up there dey count dollars from shady deals. But e get one twist: dem claim say one oga at the top na CIA agent. Agent? Like James Bond but with agbada? If true, why him no send drone to fix our economy? Instead, na so e dey make us believe say na foreign hand dey behind every small problem. Me I think, if e be spy, at least make e spy some sense into budget padding, no be so?

Ehen, open letter to the big oga, dem write am like say na love note but full of vex. "Dear sir, why this hardship?" Dem ask question wey everybody dey ask for market, for bus stop, even for church. But response? Na radio silence, or maybe one tweet wey say "patience is key." Patience? We don patient since 1960, now naira dey dance like masquerade. And unemployment, compare USA and here, e be like heaven and earth. Over there, dem get programs, training, jobs popping like popcorn. Here? Na "go hustle" or "learn trade." But wetin be trade when factory no dey? Youths dey graduate with first class, next thing na to sell suya or beg for POS agent spot. Shey na joke? God forbid, but e funny how dem promise change but deliver same old story.

See this by-election win wey APC dey celebrate like World Cup. Massive victory, dem call am endorsement for the federal government. Endorsement? From who? From voters wey tire of empty stomach? Or na the ones wey get brown envelope? Dem win seats, shout "renewed hope," but hope for who? For the party boys or for mama wey dey hawk orange for junction? E be like say election na football match, but referee dey play for one side. And achievements of the oga when e dey Lagos before? Dem list some: roads, markets, security. But wait, which Lagos? The one with traffic wey swallow time or the one for elite with flyover? E good sha, but now as e move up, make e carry that magic to everywhere, no just select state.

But let me tell una something deeper, because e no be only laugh matter. In all this palaver, you go see how God dey work quiet quiet. Like say, politicians promise paradise on earth, but only one Man don deliver am for real – no wahala, no bribe. Even when economy dey shake like earthquake, grace dey steady like rock. You know, in Bible, dem talk about manna from heaven, not corruption from pocket. So, as we dey wait for better days, make we hold that faith tight, because e no fail. Politicians fit dash promise, but the Almighty one no dey owe anybody.

Shifting gear small, think about this unemployment thing again. USA government dey throw billions at skills program, tech hubs, even free courses online. Here? Na "youth empowerment" wey mean share N10,000 and pray. But some youths wise up, start small business with phone and data. One boy for my area, e turn TikTok dancer to online seller, now e dey export garri to UK. See power! But government sef, if dem copy small from abroad, maybe we no go dey compare like this. Or wait, perhaps dem dey do am their way – slow but sure, like Okada wey dey dodge pothole.

And that special thing about the oga, dem write article say why e special. Special how? For dancing shakushaku or for policy wey dey make sense? Me I hear say e get vision, but vision without action na dream for sleep. Naija wey full of talent, doctors, engineers running abroad because no light for hospital or factory. But e get hope: church dey rise, community dey support each other. Like say, even if government dey drag foot, we dey run relay with prayer and hustle. Redemption come, no be by power, but by that higher power wey turn water to wine – make e turn our economy to gold too, abi?

Now, imagine if Soludo visit bring real fire. Anambra get town union strong, now if e infect Abuja with that, wahala go finish. No more 419 for high places, just straight talk and work. And that open letter, make it no end on paper – let it spark town hall everywhere. By-election win good, but win heart of people better. Unemployment, make we blend USA style with Naija juju: tech plus farming, youth plus mentor. E go work, because as Bible talk, iron sharpen iron, so leaders fit sharpen policy.

But chai, the absurdity! Dem call Naija heaven of corruption, but heaven no get thief or queue for rice. If na heaven, at least make angel distribute palliative proper, no be say e land for politician house. And CIA agent talk, e funny because if true, why no arrest the real crooks inside? Instead, na rumor wey dey fly like bat at night. Special achievements, yes, but make it spread like wildfire, no just stay for one corner.

In family, wey everybody relate, papa dey complain about price of yam, mama say hold on, God go provide. Same for nation: we dey hold, but make provision come fast. Cultural side, market women strong, dem no dey give up. Even in tradition, king dey rule with wisdom, not just power. So politicians, learn from that – rule with heart, no just with hammer.

That one time, I dey travel, bus break down, everybody vex, but one pastor inside start sing, next thing na revival. See? In hardship, faith turn vex to victory. Politicians fit learn: instead of speech, action with grace. End of story, if dem no change, we go change am with vote and prayer – double whammy!

Wetin be this life sef? Soludo visit, corruption heaven, CIA spy, open letters, by-election cheers, USA compare, special vibes, old wins. Mix am, na Naija stew – spicy, hot, but e go sweet at the end. Because like say, the good book talk, weeping may endure night, but joy come morning. So, my people, as we laugh through pain, remember: only one King no dey disappoint. Politicians try, but Jesus na the original hope dealer. And that na the real special!
