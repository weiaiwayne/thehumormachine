Ehen, make we yarn about this matter wey dey hot like fresh akara for morning sun. You see this our big oga, President Tinubu, just dey handle wahala from across the ocean like say e be local champion wey no fear anybody. Dem talk say Trump threaten to send soldiers come here, like say na film script from Hollywood. But our man no shake, e summon all those foreign envoys for Abuja, dey tell dem say we no dey play. Me sef, I imagine am: Trump dey tweet from Mar-a-Lago, dey flex muscle like wrestler, but Tinubu just cool, cool, respond say we dey talk diplomacy. Shey you no see? One dey do Twitter war, the other dey sip tea with sense. If na me, I for just send am jollof rice with pepper wey go make am regret, abi? But no, e choose peace, and Bible talk say blessed are the peacemakers. So, e dey shine light even for dark times like this.

Now, shift gear small, because politics no dey sleep. Over for Bayelsa, the governor there dump that old party, PDP, jump enter APC like say na better deal for Black Friday. E get as e be: one day na red, next day na broom wey dey sweep clean. People dey ask, wetin really change? E be like say dem dey play musical chairs, but the music no stop, just the song change. Imagine if life be like that: today you dey one job, tomorrow you jump to another because dem promise better salary wey no come. But for our side, na power and connection dey call the shot. E remind me of that story for Good Book, where Judas switch side for silver, but here, na for governor chair. At least, e no sell am out completely; e just dey find where the grass dey greener. And for we the people? We just dey watch, pray say e no turn wahala to bigger storm. Grace go cover am, sha.

But wait, let me land this one proper before we move. This jumping from party to party, e dey make me think of how we Nigerians dey survive economy wey dey bite like hungry dog. You go market, price don climb higher than Sycamore tree, but you still manage buy small thing chop. Same way, politicians dey manage their ambition, switch lane like danfo driver for third mainland. One minute, dem dey promise heaven on earth, next, dem dey align with who hold the key. Bayelsa man do am smooth, no drama, just announcement wey shock everybody. Even the opposition dey scratch head, wonder wetin next. Me, I dey laugh because if na me, I for stay neutral like Tinubu for that Anambra matter. APC hail am for that one, say e no take side, just dey look like referee wey no blow whistle yet. Neutrality for politics? Na rare commodity, like steady light without gen. But e work, and e show say sometimes, silence dey louder than shout.

Speaking of shouts, let us talk this doctors strike wey government finally dey end. Resident doctors fold hand, no work, because salary and condition no fine. Hospitals empty like ghost town, people dey suffer, waiting for small fever to turn epidemic. Then, boom, government move, promise to fix am. E be like miracle, abi? One day na darkness, next day light dey shine. But you sabi say for Naija, promise na like juju; e fit work or backfire. Dem talk say negotiations don reach, money go flow, strike go end. Good news, because who no want doctor wey no dey vex? Imagine you dey bed, sick, and doctor dey there with stethoscope but mind dey far, thinking of better pay elsewhere. E no good. But now, with this resolution, hope dey come back. And as Christian, I know say God dey healer above all, but e no mean say we no go use human hand join. Politicians, una do well small; keep the peace, make health no turn weapon.

That one take me to another angle: insecurity wey dey everywhere, like shadow wey no gree comot. Tinubu meet regional ministers, dey yarn about projects and safety. Dem gather, plan how to tackle bandits and all that nonsense wey dey make people fear to sleep. E get time when you go wake for night, hear sound, pray say na just cat, no be thief. But government dey try, meeting here, deploying there. Still, e dey take time, like Lagos rain wey no quick stop. I remember one time, my neighbor dey boast say e get security light, but NEPA take am, and darkness swallow everything. Same for country: light dey flicker, but we dey push for steady glow. Ministers dey talk projects, roads, bridges, all to bring peace. Shey e go work? Time go tell, but faith without work na dead, so dem better move fast. We no want more stories of villages wey turn battlefield; we want testimonies of safety and progress.

Now, let me twist this to environment, because Sanwo-Olu, that Lagos governor, dey appeal to investors for climate change summit. E talk say make una come, invest, because global warming no dey joke. Flood dey come, heat dey rise, like oven wey no off. But e be irony: here we dey, with potholes wey swallow cars, and now climate wahala on top. Investors dey listen? Some yes, some dey watch from afar, like say Naija na risky bet. Sanwo-Olu paint picture of green future, renewable energy, all that jazz. Me, I dey support, because who no want clean air without generator smoke? Imagine Lagos without that black cloud from okadas; paradise, abi? But reality hit hard: while dem talk carbon footprint, people still dey trek because bus fare don high. Still, e dey inspiring, this push for better. And Bible say earth na Lord's, so we suppose care for am, no just chop and run. Governor, keep pushing; make investors see the vision, turn talk to action.

Ehen, one more thing before I round this yarn: this NNPC and refinery deal, extending supply with naira, no more dollar wahala. Dem dey talk, negotiate, like old friends settling score. Good move, because exchange rate dey dance samba, making everything expensive. If crude go with local money, maybe fuel price go calm small, people go breathe. But you know Naija: deal fit sweet on paper, sour for pocket. Still, hope dey, like morning sun after storm. Politicians dey try bridge gaps, from oil to diplomacy, all to make life easier. Trump threat? Handled. Party switch? Survived. Strikes? Ending. E dey look like step forward, even if small.

But here's the real joke: in all this, we Nigerians still dey stand, laugh, and pray. Because if no be God grace, who go hold us? Politicians come and go, threats fade, but faith remain steady. So, next time wahala knock, remember: e pass, and better day dey come. No shaking!
