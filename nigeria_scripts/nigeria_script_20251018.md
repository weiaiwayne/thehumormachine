Ah, brothers and sisters, let's talk about this recent drama with our leaders shaking hands like old pals at a village wedding. Governor Soludo rolls up to Aso Rock to see President Tinubu, and suddenly it's all smiles and backslaps on the news. Shey you see am? One minute Soludo is fixing roads in Anambra, next thing he's in Abuja playing diplomat. Me I dey think, maybe he's there to collect blueprint for how to turn potholes into swimming pools or something. Because wahala no dey finish for this side. They pose for pictures, exchange pleasantries, and we the people? We just dey watch, hoping say one good thing go drop from that meeting, like manna from heaven.

But wait, enter the twist. Everywhere you turn, people dey whisper that Tinubu na CIA plant, straight from America to control our oil or whatever. Chai, Hollywood don enter Naija politics! Imagine James Bond in agbada, sipping ogogoro instead of martini. I picture am: Tinubu with a hidden earpiece, whispering codes to Langley while signing bills. "Agent T, confirm the naira devaluation." No be small thing o. If e true, then why our economy still dey shake like harmattan wind? Maybe the CIA budget cut, or they forgot to send the memo on how to fix unemployment. Because while America dey roll out tech jobs and stimulus checks, here we dey hustle for okada or queue for rice from palliative.

Speaking of queues, that open letter to Tinubu wey one guy drop online? E sweet pass Nollywood script. The writer pour out heart, begging for better days, less suffering, more jobs. Beautiful words, full of passion, like psalm in the Bible. But response? Silence, or maybe a tweet saying "we dey work." Work ke? If e be so, then why my cousin wey graduate university three years ago still dey sell recharge cards for junction? Shey na redemption story or just another chapter in the struggle? Even Jesus turned water to wine at a party; these ones turn promises to dust.

Now, APC go blow grammar about their by-election victory, calling am massive endorsement of Tinubu's administration. Massive how? They win few seats, and suddenly e mean say all na correct. Abi na the opponents sleep off that day? I laugh because in Naija, victory na like jollof rice contest – everybody claim say theirs sweet pass, but hunger still dey belly. They say e show say people support the vision. Vision for wetin? For more visits between governors and president, or for tackling that "heaven of corruption" label wey international bodies dey tag us? Because if corruption na heaven, then some politicians must be angels with wings made of briefcases full of dollars.

Let me paint picture for una. Imagine heaven gates, but instead of St. Peter, na EFCC chairman dey check manifest. "Sorry o, your bribe record too long; go hell side." Yet, our leaders dey move like say nothing happen. Soludo visits Tinubu, they talk development, but back home, youth dey march for streets demanding jobs. USA government? They dey train people for AI, green energy, all that jazz. Here? We dey pray for steady power, but even God sef know say grace no fit charge gen forever. Though, e be like say divine intervention needed, because politicians' plans alone no reach.

And why Tinubu special, according to some fans? They list achievements from his Lagos days – bridges, markets, that kind vibe. Fair enough, man build things. But special to who? To the elite wey dey fly first class, or to the market woman wey price of tomatoes don turn her gray? E special like that uncle wey promise to send money from abroad, but e land as alert for 500 naira. We appreciate the effort, sha, but make e special reach ground level. Because faith without works na dead, as the Good Book talk. Shey una agree?

That by-election win dey remind me of family gatherings, where uncle wins argument and claim say everybody support am. But deep down, auntie dey hiss under breath. APC dey celebrate, opposition dey cry foul, and we? We just wan eat. Unemployment wahala no dey respect party lines. In America, they got programs teaching coding to kids from hoods; here, we dey teach survival from cradle. My brother try apply for job last week – 500 applicants for one spot. E be like biblical multitude feeding on five loaves, but no miracle happen; everybody go home empty.

Now, tie am back to Soludo's visit. Maybe he went to whisper secrets on how to beat the CIA rumors. "Baba, dem say you na spy; how we go debunk?" Tinubu laugh, "My son, just build more roads; people go forget." True talk, because Naija memory short like okada fuel. But seriously, if Tinubu na agent, then make he call headquarters for real help – send experts to fix our rails, not just visitations. Or better, teach us how to turn corruption heaven into prosperity paradise. Because right now, e feel like wandering in wilderness, waiting for promised land.

And that "why Tinubu special" list? E long o, from sanitation to security back in his governor time. Impressive, no doubt. But special na when e touch everybody life. Like grace wey cover all sins, make this leadership cover all struggles. No be only for big men; make e rain on the small farmer, the teacher wey no dey collect salary on time. Shey you feel me? Because if not, then na just another tale in our endless comedy of errors.

Let me shift gear small. Imagine if that open letter writer meet Tinubu face to face, like Soludo did. "Mr. President, unemployment dey kill us; USA dey do am better." Tinubu nod, "We go try." Try? Brother, we don try since 1960! E be like David facing Goliath with slingshot made of rubber band. But faith sef na action; maybe time to sling some real stones at these problems. No be to dey visit and pose; na to deliver.

Finally, as APC dey pat themselves back for that win, remember say endorsement no fill pot of soup. People vote because alternative worse, or hope say things go change. But hope alone no cook jollof. Make una use that momentum to tackle the real heaven – the one wey corruption no dey gatecrash. And if Tinubu truly special, let am show by turning whispers to shouts of joy across the land. Otherwise, we go continue to laugh through the tears, because that's Naija spirit – resilient like palm tree in storm. But one day, e go better, by God's own special grace. Amen to that, abi?
