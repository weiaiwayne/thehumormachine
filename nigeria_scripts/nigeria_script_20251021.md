Ah, my people, imagine dis one: Governor Soludo dey roll up to Aso Rock, shaking hands with President Tinubu like say dem dey plan wedding for next year. You see am? One minute Soludo dey fix Anambra roads, next thing e don turn pilgrim, trekking to see di big man. Me I dey think, wetin dem talk inside dat room? "Oga, your fuel subsidy removal don scatter my budget o." And Tinubu go reply, "No wahala, collect dis blueprint from my Chicago days." Chicago? Abeg, if na true American style, dem suppose dash am one pizza delivery service for di whole country. But no, na just photo ops and press release wey say everything dey fine. Shey you understand? Dem visit like say e go solve hunger, but outside, market women still dey haggle for one tuber of yam like e be gold bar.

Dat one dey remind me of dis open letter wey one person dash Tinubu. E be like say di writer sit down for corner, pen di thing, seal am, but forget to post am. "Dear Mr. President, your policies don make graduate turn Uber driver." And Tinubu go read am, nod head, den file am under "fan mail." Me I laugh, because if na true open letter, why e no go viral like TikTok dance? Nigerians love to talk, but when e reach action, na only comment section full. Picture dis: di letter writer dey expect reply from State House, but instead, one aide go call am, "Bros, your letter sweet, but send am to WhatsApp group first." Abi, dat na how we do for here? We write manifestos longer dan Bible, but execute am shorter dan exam time.

Now, let me yarn you about dis by-election win wey APC dey celebrate like say dem discover oil again. Massive victory, dem talk, endorsement for Tinubu's team. Haba, which kain endorsement be dat? Dem win one local seat, next day e turn national anthem. "See, people love our leader!" But wait, di people wey vote, half of dem no chop dat day. E be like say dem vote because candidate promise free data bundle, not because of policy. And di opposition? Dem dey cry foul, say rigging everywhere, but me I know, for Naija politics, rigging na like jollof rice – every party get im own recipe. Tinubu dey special, dem say, because e fit turn loss to win. Special how? Like magician wey hide card under sleeve? Or like pastor wey prophesy rain but carry umbrella? E sweet to watch, but di real magic na how ordinary man still dey survive di fallout.

Speaking of survival, let us compare how America and we dey handle joblessness. Over there, government dey throw billions at training programs, tech hubs, even pay you to learn coding. Here? Dem talk of youth empowerment, but e end up as one seminar where speaker collect allowance and dash you motivational poster. "Hustle hard!" Poster go say, but wetin you go hustle with when factory close down? Graduate wey read engineering now dey sell recharge card for junction. US government vs ours: dem build Silicon Valley, we build survival valley. Tinubu go promise skills acquisition, but skills to acquire na how to dodge potholes or bargain with danfo driver. Shey e no funny? One side, Obama care for health; here, we get prayer care for everything. And di youth? Dem turn entrepreneurs by force – pure water business, okada riding, or dat new one, social media influencing where you beg for likes to eat.

E get why dem call Tinubu special, though. From Lagos days, e build bridges, roads, even dat one light rail wey shine like new bride. Achievements plenty, but di question na, who di achievements reach? Di elite go cruise for new expressway, but di okada man still dey dodge trailers on old path. E be like say progress dey selective, like buffet where rich pick first. And now, as president, e dey tackle big issues, but sometimes e feel like e dey play chess while we dey play draughts on street. Special, yes, but special with grace – like how Bible talk say even king need wisdom from above. Without dat, all di plans go scatter like sand.

But wait, dis CIA agent talk wey people dey whisper about Tinubu? Haba, which kain Nollywood plot be dat? Dem say e be American spy, sent to control oil or scatter wahala. Me I dey laugh, because if na true, why e no fix power first? CIA get budget for drone, we get NEPA for darkness. Imagine Tinubu dey report to Washington: "Boss, I remove subsidy, now people dey queue like Black Friday." And CIA go reply, "Good job, now make dem buy generator from our company." Conspiracy everywhere, but truth na say our leaders no need foreign agent – dem get local 419 spirit wey work overtime. One day, headline go read "Tinubu: CIA or Just Clever Igbo?" No, wait, e be Yoruba, but point na, labels no solve problem. E better we pray for leaders wey get heart like David, not schemes like Judas.

Now, picture market life under all dis policy. Woman wey sell vegetable, she wake 5am, arrange stall, but by noon, price don jump because dollar strong. She go look sky, say "God, wetin be dis?" And truly, faith na di only steady thing. Politicians promise heaven on earth, but only one King deliver eternal one. So, even when economy dey shake, we hold on to dat promise – grace wey no fail, like sun wey rise despite rain. Dat na why we laugh; because if we no laugh, tears go finish tissue.

Dat CIA rumor take me to foreign wahala. America dey watch us, dey talk human rights, but dem own police dey shoot for less. We get our own drama – open letters, visits, wins – but at end, e all point to one thing: need for real change from above. Not Washington, but higher. Tinubu special? Yes, but all of us special in God's eye. So, next time Soludo visit, make dem yarn about unity, not just handshakes. And for unemployment, instead of comparison, make we build our own valley of skills, where youth no dey idle.

E sweet to think, though, if Tinubu read dat open letter and act. Maybe e go dash jobs like manna. But reality? We go continue hustle, pray, and crack jokes. Because laughter na medicine wey no need prescription. And in dis our land, where every day na adventure, who no fit laugh? Even when plans scatter, God's plan stand. So, keep smiling, my people – tomorrow fit better, or at least e go give new material.
