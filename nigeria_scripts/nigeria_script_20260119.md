Wetin dey happen for this our side these days ehn, e be like say world leaders don turn our matter to their own personal soap opera. You hear am? That big man from across the waters, the one wey dey wear that orange tie like na uniform, him don wake up one morning and decide say e wan send troops come scatter everything. And our own headman, Tinubu, no dull o, him summon all those embassy people for Abuja, like say na family meeting wey dem go settle the wahala with small jollof and small talk. But wait o, shey una think say diplomacy go work when the other side dey talk military? Na so e be, person go dey promise peace with one hand, while the other hand dey sharpen knife. Me sef, I dey wonder if dem go invite me to that meeting, abi? Cos I get sense pass some of those suits.

Now, shift gear small, make we yarn about this other drama wey dey play out with our former soldier-turned-elder statesman, Babangida. Tinubu don roll out congratulatory message for him 84th birthday, like say na Grammy award. E sweet o, to see old generals shaking hands with current bosses, but e remind me of those village festivals where everybody pretend say no bad blood. You know how e dey be, when person don old, dem go hail am like say him never chop coup for breakfast back in the days. But deep down, we all sabi say history no dey forget. E be like say politicians dey recycle themselves like old bottles – empty am, fill am again with new promises, and sell am to the market. And the people? We go buy am, cos wetin we go do? Na the same old wine for new skin, but e still dey taste somehow. Abi una agree? Even the Bible talk say old wine na the best, but if e turn vinegar, better find water to dilute.

Speaking of recycling, see this Bayelsa matter wey dey hot like fresh akara. The governor there, him don jump ship from PDP to APC, like say na bus conductor wey change route midway. One day na red, next day na broom. E be like musical chairs for power, everybody dey scramble to sit down before the music stop. And the followers? Dem go follow, cos loyalty na like rubber band – stretch am too far, e go snap. Me I dey laugh, cos imagine if life na so: today you dey one party, tomorrow you dey another, and nobody ask question. But for real life, if you try that for wedding, na fight you go see. Politicians get grace to switch sides without apology, while we ordinary mortals go dey explain for days. Na wa o. And Tinubu, him dey hail neutrality for Anambra side, like referee wey no wan take side. But who believe say neutrality exist for this game? E be like referee wey dey blow whistle for both teams at once – confusion everywhere.

That one don sweet me, now make we touch on this climate change talk wey Sanwo-Olu dey push for global investors. Him dey appeal say make dem bring money come build green things for Lagos, but wait, shey una see the irony? The same place wey danfo dey smoke like chimney, now dey invite billionaires to plant trees. E good sha, but e remind me of that uncle wey go church every Sunday to confess, then come house and continue the same old habits. "Oga, reduce emissions," dem say, but generator go still dey roar for night. And the investors? Dem go come, take pictures, promise heaven, then fly back to their air-conditioned villas. We go remain with the wahala, sweating under sun while dem dey count dollars. But hope dey, cos even when the world dey heat up, God's promise of renewal no dey fail. Like that verse wey talk say new heavens and earth go come, no more tears or pollution. Politicians fit delay, but the ultimate fixer no dey sleep.

Now, yarn go sweet if we look at this NNPC and Dangote refinery deal wey dem dey extend. Crude oil for naira, no more dollar wahala. Sounds like breakthrough, abi? But e be like trying to fix leaking roof with small patch – rain go still come. Dem dey talk extension, but how many times we hear "deal" before, and na same old story? The refinery wey suppose save us from import beg, now dey negotiate like market women haggling over tomatoes. And the people? We go queue for fuel still, or whatever e turn to next. E dey funny how big men dey play chess with our daily bread, while we dey hustle for crumbs. But me sef, I dey pray say this one go work, cos faith without action na dead, and action without faith na confusion. Let dem extend that deal till kingdom come, and maybe we go see light at end of tunnel.

Shift again, make we laugh about this Igbos for Lagos matter wey people dey yarn say one unity na illusion. Some say lopsided projects dey favor one side, like say Tinubu na Lagos mayor instead of national papa. E be like family gathering where one sibling dey chop all the meat, and others dey eye am. But wetin we go do? Na the same pot wey dey cook for all. And the youth? Dem dey shout unemployment, but dem no dey teach how to turn palm wine to export. Wait, that na idea o – Nigerian drummers confessing say dem wan global tour, but first, fix the roads. E dey absurd, but that's life here. Even in the midst of mirage, grace dey hold us. Like David wey face Goliath with stone, we go face these giants with wit and prayer, till dem fall.

One more angle before I wrap this yarn: this doctors strike wey government dey move to end. Resident doctors fold arms, patients dey suffer, and bosses dey promise salary. Classic script – wahala, negotiation, temporary peace. But shey e go last? Na like patching pothole with sand; next rain, na flood. And the world bank chiefs wey Tinubu meet? Dem go advise on economy, but advice na free, action na the price. Him depart for Japan and Brazil, seeking investment, like beggar wey dress fine go knock on rich man's door. E inspiring sha, cos even Paul wey travel far dey spread good news, and Tinubu fit bring back some. But if e no work, we go still survive with our jara spirit.

Finally, e be like say all these twists dey teach us one thing: in the middle of threats, switches, and appeals, the real power no dey with man, but with the one wey control the universe. Politicians fit threaten or congratulate, but only divine hand fit turn curse to blessing. So, as we dey laugh at this madness, make we hold that faith tight – cos when the show end, na eternity wey matter. And if Trump still wan try, tell am say Naija spirit no dey fear bullet; we dey dodge potholes daily. Boom!
