Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. I know, seeing those clips back-to-back is a lot to process. It's like a progressive's worst nightmare come to life, served with a side of reality.

Speaking of nightmares, did you see Kamala's latest attempt to explain the Green New Deal? It was like watching a toddler try to assemble an IKEA bookshelf. Lots of enthusiasm, zero comprehension, and ultimately ending in tears. Apparently, “equity” now means everyone gets a participation trophy, even when the trophy is made of unicorn farts and empty promises.

And speaking of empty promises, remember when they told us Trump's return would bring on the apocalypse? Yeah, still waiting for that asteroid. Instead, we got lower gas prices, a booming stock market, and liberals complaining about the noise from all the construction cranes. Apparently, prosperity is the new hate crime.

But let's talk about the real villains here: the climate activists. I saw one the other day glued to a Starbucks drive-thru. Apparently, she was protesting…coffee? Or capitalism? Or maybe just the fact that her oat milk latte was lukewarm. I swear, these people are so dedicated to saving the planet, they'll inconvenience everyone else on it. It's like their motto is, "Save the earth, one traffic jam at a time."

And AOC? Bless her heart. She accidentally endorsed a tax cut for billionaires. I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day. Of course, she immediately walked it back, claiming it was a "typo" or a "misunderstanding." Right. Like accidentally ordering a yacht instead of a Prius.

But let’s be honest, folks, the real story here is Trump. Back on the golf course, rocking that "MAGA 2028" visor. The man's already planning his next campaign before he's even finished this one. It's like he's running for president in his sleep. And you know what? He'd probably win. Because let's face it, the alternative is… well, let's just say America isn't ready for President Buttigieg's poetry slams.

I saw this article the other day claiming that Trump's policies are "divisive." Divisive? Please. He's just giving the people what they want. Low taxes, secure borders, and the satisfaction of watching liberals spontaneously combust on Twitter. What's not to love?

And speaking of Twitter, I saw some commentator complaining that Trump is "undermining democracy." Undermining democracy? The man's just tweeting! He's not invading countries or rigging elections. Unless you count rigging the election in his favor by being the only candidate people actually want to vote for.

You know, I was talking to my liberal cousin the other day, and she was telling me how Trump is "destroying the environment." I said, "Honey, the environment's been destroyed for years. Trump's just making sure we have enough plastic straws to enjoy the apocalypse."

But seriously, folks, I get it. Trump can be a bit much. He's loud, he's brash, and he occasionally tweets things that make you want to crawl under a rock. But at least he's honest. Unlike some politicians who promise you the moon and deliver a pile of lunar dust.

And let's not forget the economy. Remember when Biden promised us a "return to normalcy"? Yeah, normalcy apparently means inflation, supply chain issues, and a constant fear that your gas prices will spike higher than Hunter Biden's kite.

Trump, on the other hand, promised us jobs. And you know what? He delivered. Sure, some of those jobs might be building walls or manufacturing MAGA hats, but hey, a job's a job. And at least you can wear the hat to your next protest against… well, whatever the liberals are protesting this week.

So, what's the takeaway here, folks? Well, it's simple. America is back. We're great again. And if you don't like it, well, you can always move to Canada. Just don't forget to take your oat milk lattes with you. We're all good.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go enjoy a nice, juicy steak cooked on a gas grill. You know, to own
