    <p><strong>(RedStateRoast theme music plays, a distorted version of “God Bless America” with a heavy metal guitar solo. RedStateRoast strides confidently onto the stage, a can of Bud Light seltzer in hand.)</strong></p>
<p>Howdy, folks! RedStateRoast here, comin’ at ya live from the only comedy show that hasn’t been labeled a terrorist organization by the IRS. Yet.</p>
<p>(Takes a long swig of the seltzer)</p>
<p>Boy, what a week, huh? The swamp is so drained, you can now see all the alligators sunbathing in the muck. It’s beautiful.</p>
<p>First up, let’s talk about this "impeachment" sham. Turns out, even <em>Democrats</em> don’t want to impeach President Trump. I know, I know, shocking. It's like finding out that vegans secretly crave a good ol' Texas barbeque. Seems this Thanedar fella was gonna force a vote, and the swamp creatures, bless their black, shriveled hearts, couldn’t have <em>that</em>. Bipartisanship is alive and well, folks, at least when it comes to protecting the Orange God-Emperor from… accountability? What’s that even mean anymore?</p>
<p>(Cranes his neck to look at the news on the teleprompter)</p>
<p>Speaking of Drain the Swamp, check out this headline: "U.S. AG Pam Bondi Sold More than $1 Million in Trump Media Stock the Day Trump Announced Sweeping Tariffs." Now, that’s what I call <em>synergy</em>. You see, the libs complain we only care about money, but they're also upset when we make it? Now <em>that</em>’s projection. Plus, give Pam some credit. She knows that when our Great Leader makes a tariff announcement, it's time to get the hell out. It's called diversification, libs, learn it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some crypto to sell, and a trade deal to tweet about.</p>
<p>And speaking of grifting, is anyone surprised Qatar offered our glorious leader a free plane? It’s like offering a starving man a donut. He just can't resist. Now, the Libs are crying that it's illegal, but I say, if you got it, flaunt it. Besides, it's not like Sleepy Joe used his position to enrich his family, right? Oh wait...</p>
<p>(Looks at the teleprompter again, squints)</p>
<p>And the Supreme Court’s gonna hear this case about birthright citizenship? Oh, Lord, here we go. The libs are saying that if the Supreme Court sides with Trump, "it’ll give future presidents the power to rewrite the Constitution with an executive order." As if the Constitution hasn't been rewritten like 78 times already. Look at what they did to the Second Amendment! So, I say let the Supreme Court and the President do their thing.</p>
<p>In healthcare news, the Left are up in arms over Trump's new healthcare plan, Dr. AI. Oh the horror! How dare we innovate! Well, maybe if you could accurately diagnose a hangnail over Zoom, you might have a point. But, hey, at least Dr. AI isn't gonna ask you if you identify as a gender unicorn. Small victories, am I right? Plus, I bet Dr. AI is cheaper than Obamacare, and I am for one, ready to save some money.</p>
<p>But hey, here is the kicker: Ben &amp; Jerry's co-founder, arrested for protesting at an RFK Jr. hearing. It's a beautiful thing. When you’ve reached peak woke, you’re basically a performance artist now. Throwing a tantrum at an RFK Jr. hearing? That’s not protesting. That’s…performance art with a hint of elder abuse. Now, about that new flavor: "Social Justice Swirl?" I pass.</p>
<p>And here's a thought for all you leftists out there: I want to thank you for supporting my financial success! All your outrage, the petitions, the boycotts, the pearl-clutching? It's all free advertising! Keep it coming.</p>
<p>(Winks at the camera)</p>
<p>That's all the time we have tonight, folks. Remember, stay free, stay MAGA, and never, ever trust a vegan with a million-dollar ice cream fortune. RedStateRoast out!</p>
