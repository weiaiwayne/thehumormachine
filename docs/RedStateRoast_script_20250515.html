    <p><strong>(RedStateRoast walks onto the stage, adjusts the mic with unnecessary force, and takes a long, theatrical swig from a chipped mug. A single, unblinking spotlight illuminates him.)</strong></p>
<p>Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. I know, I know, another day, another existential crisis for the left. Must be Tuesday.</p>
<p>So, let’s check in on the state of our glorious union. It’s 2025, and apparently, the only thing bipartisan in Washington is the shared delusion that <em>someone</em> knows what they’re doing.</p>
<p>First up, RFK Jr., our new Health Secretary. The man who single-handedly keeps Big Pharma awake at night with his… <em>unique</em> approach to medical science. He’s now ordered a review of the abortion pill, mifepristone, based on some "new data" from anti-abortion groups. Turns out, "new data" is just a fancy way of saying, “We made some stuff up.” I mean, counting ectopic pregnancies as a side effect? That’s like saying driving a car causes plane crashes. Logically sound, right?</p>
<p>And the best part? This is the same guy who, like, yesterday said we shouldn’t take medical advice from him. So, to recap: He’s telling the FDA to review a drug based on bunk science, but also telling you not to listen to him. Folks, welcome to modern American healthcare. It's like letting your mechanic perform brain surgery while insisting he’s not a doctor.</p>
<p>Then there's this report that he swam in some creek that he knew was full of raw sewage, and the Fox News host said that the creek "looked clean." I'd say look who you are getting your advice from, but I feel like that's redundant. I bet the CDC will put a warning out on that creek soon enough. </p>
<p>Speaking of chaos, Penn State’s apparently running out of students. Turns out, kids are finally figuring out that a Biology degree doesn’t guarantee a job, just a mountain of debt and the existential dread of knowing you could've learned the same stuff for free on YouTube. Their solution? Increase tuition, naturally. Because if there’s one thing that attracts young people, it’s crippling debt.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on Walmart. They’re warning of higher prices thanks to those pesky Trump tariffs. You know, the ones that were supposed to make China pay? Now they’re stacking the cereal boxes sideways and laying the blame on Walmart, not Biden. It's a bold strategy, Cotton, let's see if it pays off.</p>
<p>Speaking of His Majesty, seems he’s been over in Qatar, brokering a deal for up to 210 Boeing jets. Two. Hundred. And. Ten. I’m no aviation expert, but that sounds like they’re planning to invade Delaware. Either that, or someone’s really trying to impress the Saudis with some bulk buying.</p>
<p>And while he was there, Qatar graciously offered him a gently-used, slightly-outdated 747 for, cough cough, free! I guess we should call it <em>Air Force Whenever-the-Hell-He-Feels-Like-It</em>. And it was probably a coincidence that Qatar just got done telling us they would spend a $1.2 Trillion on US goods. No quid pro quo here folks!</p>
<p>Wait a minute... It seems that plane was for sale since 2020, and nobody wanted it. You know what that means: We got Qatar to buy American goods with the promise of getting a 747. Then we gifted that 747 to our president! You know what that means? We actually did get a free airplane! Thank you Mr. President, very cool!</p>
<p>Oh, and JD Vance is headed back to the Vatican for Pope Leo’s big day. I swear, that guy is a walking papal curse. Maybe we should just keep him away from any religious figure with a life expectancy longer than a TikTok trend.</p>
<p>(leans into the mic)</p>
<p>Folks, I’m starting to think this whole “draining the swamp” thing was just a suggestion to build a water park for the elite.</p>
<p>But hey, at least overdose deaths are down, right? A whole 27%! Turns out, letting Big Pharma run wild for a few decades eventually leads to some level of… exhaustion. Though, don’t get too excited. Knowing our luck, RFK Jr. will probably ban Narcan next week, citing some new study linking it to… male pattern baldness.</p>
<p><strong>(RedStateRoast pauses, looks directly into the camera with a deadpan expression.)</strong></p>
<p>So, there you have it. The news, as seen from someone who's already accepted the apocalypse and is just trying to find the humor in it. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to go stock up on ammo and bottled water. I hear the sewage creek is going to be the new hot spot for survivalists.</p>
<p><strong>(RedStateRoast nods curtly, finishes his mug, and exits stage left to a mix of nervous laughter and polite applause.)</strong></p>
