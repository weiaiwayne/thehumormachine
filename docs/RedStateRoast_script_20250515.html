    <p>(RedStateRoast shuffles onto the stage, sets down the corn dog, and squints into the house lights.)</p>
<p>Evening, folks. Or as the shadow government refers to you: "Battery hens, producing social media clicks for the algorithm's omelet." Feels good to be back. Still un-canceled. Though I did get a strongly worded email from the NRA suggesting I "tone it down on the sentient robot jokes." Apparently, they’re a key demographic for gun sales now.</p>
<p>So, let’s dive into the bubbling cauldron of American exceptionalism, shall we?</p>
<p>First up: Balochistan. Apparently, they’re declaring independence from Pakistan. I know, I know, you’re thinking, “Where the heck is Balochistan?” Don’t worry, you're not alone. Half the State Department probably thinks it’s a new flavour of kombucha. But hey, good for them! Another country means another vote at the UN for whatever insane resolution we’re pushing this week. Although, knowing our luck, they’ll immediately recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Vermont.</p>
<p>Speaking of questionable leadership, the feds are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever decapitated that dolphin. A dolphin! Look, I’m all for protecting marine life, but 20 grand? You can get a used F-150 for that kind of money. Priorities, people!</p>
<p>And the Reddit comments? Pure gold. Apparently, everyone thinks RFK Jr. is the prime suspect. Which, let’s be honest, isn't <em>entirely</em> unreasonable. The man’s practically a walking conspiracy theory generator. I bet he thinks dolphins are actually highly evolved alien spies sent here to control our minds with sonar waves. And knowing the way things are going, he’d probably find scientific evidence to back it up.</p>
<p>Someone even suggested Trump did it, and then you know… Well, you know. It. Confirmed? Many people are saying it. See? This is why we can't have nice things.</p>
<p>But the real crime here? That dolphin had Brucella! A bacteria that causes brucellosis, which can be transferred to people through direct contact. Great. Just what we need. Another reason to avoid Florida.</p>
<p>Moving on: UnitedHealth is under criminal investigation for possible Medicare fraud. Medicare fraud! Shocking, I know. It’s not like healthcare companies are known for being bastions of ethical behaviour. I mean, come on. They’re basically legalized drug dealers in white coats.</p>
<p>The Reddit comments are even better. Unsolicited Cologuard tests? Sounds like a business model designed by a sociopath. They just keep billing Medicare for tests that people don't need. And if they get caught? A measly fine. A slap on the wrist. A gentle caress from the cold, uncaring hand of corporate justice.</p>
<p>One Redditor suggested that UnitedHealth just needs to buy some Trump crypto to get the probe dropped. I swear, satire is dead. Reality has officially jumped the shark, taken a bath in radioactive waste, and is now tap-dancing on the grave of irony.</p>
<p>And the CEO quit without warning. Because nothing says "innocent" like fleeing the scene of the crime at Mach speed.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! A Boy Hits Car concert was cancelled after a truck hit the venue. You cannot make this stuff up. I mean, seriously. That’s like Alanis Morissette writing a song about irony. Oh, wait.</p>
<p>"Boy Hits Car" is the name of the band, for those of you who are still trying to process that headline. It took me four tries, and I write comedy for a living. My therapist is going to love this.</p>
<p>The best part? The headline: "Truck Hits Whisky A Go Go; Boy Hits Car Show A No-Go." Someone deserves a Pulitzer for that. Or at least a free drink. Or maybe a lifetime supply of unsolicited Cologuard tests.</p>
<p>Look, I’m not saying the world is going crazy. I’m just saying, if you’re not laughing, you’re probably crying. And if you’re crying, you’re probably a liberal. And if you’re a liberal, well… maybe you should consider buying some Trump crypto. It couldn’t hurt. Probably.
(RedStateRoast picks up the corn dog, takes a bite, and exits stage left, leaving a trail of mustard and bewildered silence in their wake.)</p>
