*(Lights up on BlueScream, leaning against a faux-marble pillar, looking exasperatedly at a tablet)*

**BlueScream:** Welcome back to *Despair Hour*. I’m your host, still trying to figure out how “fetch” is *not* a thing, but “DOGE” is now a cabinet-level position.

(Sighs dramatically, tosses tablet onto a nearby velvet pouf)

Seriously, folks, what a week. I think I pulled a muscle just trying to keep up with the sheer volume of… *stuff*… coming out of this White House. It’s like they’re deliberately trying to overwhelm us with absurdity, daring us to even *attempt* a coherent critique. Like a comedic blitzkrieg, but instead of tanks, it’s just… terrible policy ideas.

Speaking of blitzkriegs, did you see that Trump's thinking of holding a birthday parade…with tanks? Twenty-five Abrams tanks rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue! Apparently, celebrating his 78th year requires a display of military might that would make Kim Jong Un blush. Because nothing says “quiet dignity of aging” like… well, tanks. I’m just picturing him reviewing the troops, a tiny flag in his tiny hand, looking like a toddler who’s commandeered his dad’s army surplus store.

And who’s paying for this spectacle of self-aggrandizement? Oh, just you, the American taxpayer. Because apparently, national security includes the President's ego. I swear, the only thing missing is a flock of doves released at the climax, each carrying a tiny “Trump 2028” banner.

But hey, at least he’s got his priorities straight. I mean, who needs affordable healthcare or a functioning infrastructure when you can have… tanks? And a $400 million jet from Qatar, I almost forgot! Turns out, Doha is the new Mar-a-Lago.

That's right! Apparently, "America First" now means "Qatar First… but only if they gift the President a luxury flying palace." Experts are saying this blatant quid pro quo is probably unconstitutional. "Likely." As if anyone needs an expert to tell them that accepting a half-a-billion-dollar gift from a foreign nation while simultaneously promising to "protect" them is… questionable. I mean, call me old-fashioned, but I thought “protecting” a country involved, like, *protecting* it. Not taking its Bentleys.

And speaking of the Middle East, Trump's been brokering AI deals with Saudi Arabia and the UAE like he's running a tech flea market. Apparently, he’s single-handedly ushering in a new era of global cooperation… by handing cutting-edge technology to regimes known for their… *progressive*… values.

"Oh, don't worry," he probably said. "They promised they wouldn't let China get their hands on it. Pinky swear."

It's all part of his grand plan to "Make America… uh… something… again!" I honestly can't remember the slogan anymore. Too many tanks.

And the hits just keep on coming. Kristi Noem, still trying to distract us from that unfortunate puppy incident, is now floating the idea of a reality show where immigrants *compete* for citizenship. Because nothing says “welcome to America” like… *The Hunger Games: Green Card Edition*.

I have to give her credit though: she's found a way to monetize human suffering. I mean, that's the American dream, right?

But the real kicker this week? The GOP’s budget proposal. They’re planning to cut taxes for the rich, slash Medicaid, and… wait for it… tax remittances sent by migrants to their home countries. Seriously?

So, let me get this straight: the folks who *literally* built this country are now going to be taxed for the audacity of sending money home to their families? It’s like a reverse “thank you for your service” bonus. “Here’s a pat on the back… now give us your wallet.”

And of course, nobody is safe, even my personal hero, Ben and Jerry co-founder Ben Cohen, was arrested this week for protesting the Gaza blockade during a Senate hearing. God bless him, but when the guy who makes Chunky Monkey is getting hauled off in cuffs, you know things have gone off the rails. This isn’t a government, it’s a reality TV show directed by a sugar-addled chimpanzee.

But hey, at least we're getting our COVID vaccine advice from RFK Jr., the new head of Health and Human Services! I mean, who needs peer-reviewed science when you can get your medical advice from a guy who thinks worms are eating his brain? Talk about government efficiency!

You know, sometimes I wonder if we're all just living in a simulation. Maybe some bored alien is watching our planet and saying, “Hey, check out this one. They’re *literally* begging for a dictatorship!”

(Looks directly into the camera, a glimmer of hope in her eyes)

But then, I remember: we're Americans. We're resilient. We’re… uh… we’re…

(Stares blankly for a moment, then waves dismissively)

We're… something. We'll figure it out. Eventually. Right after this commercial break. Don't go anywhere.
