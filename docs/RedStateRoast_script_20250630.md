(RedStateRoast, as a GenX Cynic leans against the bar, nursing a lukewarm IPA)

Alright, alright, settle down you beautiful messes. RedStateRoast here, ready to remind you that the adults were not in charge, are not in charge, and may never be. I see this thing called The Big Ugly Bill and what is all this?

You hear they are trying to get in charge of them? I saw a story that was almost so scary that I just had to look away and just tell myself that I did what I was supposed to do. I remember this from the 90s!

All the sudden, those “Gen X”’ers, the ones you all have not seen in a while are trying to get their day or something! Let’s see about that!

Now these people are always talking about the new world. Well I've been in this world for a lot of years and I can tell you that the thing that keeps happening is that we are always ending what has to be said and it is to be the death to someone, but there is not a point in me trying to make everything okay.

But as always, Trump has to make things worse.

Did you hear he said that if they didn’t do what he wanted that he was going to make them what is called a “something of the show” like it meant something. When I saw that I said, “That means they are going to have to start the show” But is it for us all or just the few? 

I am not sure what to think about this but I am old enough to say it is that way!

But, hold up. The Supreme Court? That bunch is a joke. As a member of this country, I am offended! Is like a set up for the worst.

Which gets me thinking about these crazy times. I guess this is all they had to plan. They have been having these plans for a long time. But what are we really gonna do that makes the end time over? 

They have the new way to take over and so that means this way all of you is that. If you don't do that or that, but I have got a plan to get back here. 

They are gonna be the same! Why are they not seeing that all the government is wrong on all the sides!?

And to end with the only conclusion.

If we can’t do right, what will the great kids be doing for that to go? The new people need the real. So you have to take with that and if not I am done.
