Alright, alright, settle down, patriots. Or, as we’re calling you now, “Patriots 2: Electric Boogaloo.” Because let’s face it, the sequel’s never as good as the original. Unless we’re talking about the *Fast & Furious* franchise. Then…well, then we’re just talking about something else entirely, aren't we? Something…inexplicable.

Speaking of inexplicable, remember when we all thought 2020 was the peak of absurdity? Like, "Okay, that's it, folks. The universe has officially run out of plot twists. We're at the narrative singularity." Turns out, the universe was just warming up. It was like, "Hold my beer… or, you know, my kombucha, because I’m trying to be healthy while simultaneously orchestrating the downfall of Western civilization."

And here we are, folks. 2025. Trump's back in the White House. Again. It's like Groundhog Day, but instead of Bill Murray learning to play the piano, we're all learning to tolerate Fox News' extended metaphor about the "stolen" 2024 election. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t stolen. The voting machines weren't hacked by space aliens. People just... voted. In a way that makes some people very, very upset.

I saw a Reddit post the other day that perfectly encapsulated the national mood. It said, "I'm starting to think the Founding Fathers didn't anticipate the internet." Which, you know, fair. They were busy writing the Constitution with quill pens and complaining about taxes on tea. They probably figured future generations would be arguing about something equally profound, like the optimal way to brew coffee. Not… whether or not a guy who tweets like a caffeinated squirrel should have access to the nuclear codes.

And what's he been up to? Well, besides the usual golf outings with dictators and the late-night Twitter rants about "fake news" and "low-energy losers," he's been really focused on… infrastructure. Yes, you heard me right. Infrastructure. Turns out, even a reality TV star with a penchant for gold-plated toilets can appreciate a well-paved road. Although, I suspect his idea of "infrastructure" involves building a giant, gold-plated wall around Mar-a-Lago. Just to keep the riff-raff out, of course. And by "riff-raff," I mean anyone who doesn't own at least three yachts.

But it's not just Trump, is it? No, no, no. That would be far too simple. We've got a whole cast of characters vying for the title of "Most Likely To Cause an International Incident." We've got Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's now convinced that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by… wait for it… lizard people. I swear, I'm not making this up. At this point, I'm pretty sure the writers of *The X-Files* are sitting at home, scratching their heads, and saying, "Okay, even we wouldn't go there."

And then there's Senator Ted Cruz, who's apparently decided that his new brand is "ironic victimhood." He’s constantly complaining about being unfairly targeted by the "liberal elite," even though he's literally a United States Senator. It's like watching a millionaire complain about having to pay taxes. You just want to scream, "Sir, you are the establishment! Stop pretending you're fighting the man!"

But the real kicker? The thing that truly makes you question the very fabric of reality? It's the fact that gas prices are still through the roof. I mean, come on! We've got flying cars, self-folding laundry, and robot dogs that can fetch you a beer, but we still can't figure out how to make gasoline affordable? It’s like we prioritized all the wrong things. We spent all our time developing technology that makes our lives easier, but we forgot to solve the basic problems, like… you know… surviving.

I saw another Reddit post that said, "I'm starting to think the future isn't what we thought it would be." And you know what? They're right. We were promised jetpacks and moon colonies. Instead, we got political polarization, crippling student loan debt, and the constant threat of nuclear annihilation.

But hey, at least we have memes. Right? I mean, what else are we supposed to do? Laugh? Cry? Move to Canada? Actually, scratch that last one. Canada's full. Besides, they're probably just as confused as we are. They're just
