## RedStateRoast

(RedStateRoast, as a policy wonk from a conservative think tank, approaches the mic. He adjusts his glasses and pulls out a heavily annotated copy of the Congressional Budget Office report.)

Okay, okay, hold on a minute. All this talk about drones in the sky, lizards runnin‚Äô the government what are we in 1950? As a researcher and a man of sound mind, I can see that it has all the hallmarks of what should be a bad thing that is coming to all. It's just what is wrong as wrong!

I listened to what he was saying about the end to the madness, or the end of this what? We are talking about the way to have an impact of all the good things that we get, to stop what is good?

Well I think you‚Äôre too busy looking for those things that have come to the new world order and that has more than most to have just put us all under!

It's not as dangerous to be here!

What you're not looking at is the numbers. Let's talk about the CBO. Did you guys see that this number that is 3.5 or something? It's a lot! The budget has to balance or there is not going to be enough for everyone! And they know this.

And while everyone keeps talking about what will happen, where have the numbers gone? 

(he flips through the CBO report with increasing agitation)

Now I am not going to say I am right, or that they are wrong. I am just saying that maybe we should think about this and say listen up!

We need to have all those people here so that we can start the work. And I want to see the kids go to school and I want to make sure the money gets to the right people and it‚Äôs not getting spent on those things.

You know I thought I saw all of this in 2009 but it was actually much more different than that, and listen I am a very bright man and a hard worker and I said to myself, ‚ÄúWhy am I always being on the side of the money?‚Äù Well let me tell you because all of the people were on the side and I have to do good for all of me and see where it all goes!

But if you ask me if there is a plan here I have to say I don‚Äôt think that all what happens happens to all!
There is just only way for that to even if they ask me!
There has to be a line!
It has to be that easy to put on.

You have just read a fresh batch of Reddit posts and a web search summary about the latest US politics:

Post: ‚ÄúWhere is Kate?‚Äù Conspiracy Theory Goes Viral on TikTok

Top Comments:
- I have had a few ask me this. I am in the US, and they ask if I have heard the rumours surrounding her.

They then tell me ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù before i can stop them. ü§£
- I had to block my Qanon grandma because her constant conspiracy theories about Kate were clogging my feed.

It's all been really wild.
- At this point, you can‚Äôt even criticize her without being labelled an incel.

There it is. That's how you know they're getting worried

I thought you have to wait until the end of the trial to do that


Post: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all in jail‚Äù: Trump says all January 6 defendants should be released

Top Comments:
- Why are these threads locked? I have so many thoughts about this and there's nowhere to put them.
- Because it‚Äôs a constant cycle. Trump commits a crime, lies about it, gets called out, and then cries about it. What more is there to say, really?
- Isn‚Äôt that obstruction of justice? And tampering with witnesses?
- "It's okay to break the law if you do it for me." - DJT
- So, he's admitting they were guilty of something?
- Remember the one where he said he would pay the legal bills for anyone who beat up a protester at his rallies?
- ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all in jail‚Ä¶ for me‚Äù
- Well, some of them got pardoned... So... that's kinda the same.
- He just inadvertently admitted they committed crimes.
- Well, isn‚Äôt that the entire point?
- Now he can pardon them again.
- It‚Äôs a cult, what do you expect?
- For him


Post: NY Democrat vows to make 'life a living hell' for ICE chief amid Trump crackdown

Top Comments:
- > "‚ÄúFor every single day that you continue to attack the people of our state and our city, I will make your life a living hell,‚Äù Niou said. ‚ÄúEvery single day, every single moment.‚Äù"

That sounds like a threat and should be considered a crime.
- I dont see a problem.

Now do trump
- Now THERE's a Democrat who gets it and is willing to fight back and not just give weak statements condemning.
- So basically threatening.
- Someone doesn't understand that the ICE chief just works there. He's following orders.
- This is a direct threat to a public servant.

## BlueScream

(BlueScream, biohazard suit hissing softly, adjusts the microphone, a cough rumbling through the respirator)

Okay, okay, okay, so, like, RedStateRoast and that crystal lady were talking about good and bad people, and I just‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not about the *people*, man. It‚Äôs about the *systems*. The code. You know what my grandma taught me? She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all just the government, and they all eat at the same dinner.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt need anyone because I was always trying to help all these people.

The last guy was just trying to do what that was all about. It never gets to those people, because those people don‚Äôt know why!

(She adjusts her respirator, and the Geiger counter clicks faster.)

That's why I had to find all the real stuff! To save all of you! 

(Her voice hitches, and for a moment, she sounds genuinely unhinged.)

I thought if I just sold everything I had and then put up the new store things would be better!

Anyway, you know what they did to that guy, the new guy to make fun of it? It's all these people are that they don‚Äôt want the world to say what is happening because they can‚Äôt get to the people with the same problem!

What I am trying to tell you is that if they can not do it this one day, then what is what! It‚Äôs the world we are trying to help them and the people they are not getting the stuff! But I can‚Äôt say what they are for these guys! I mean! There isn‚Äôt! So they have to know the facts and you can‚Äôt make that happen!

Now listen here: I think that it should have all come to this place that it is what it is. Because then there are people that don‚Äôt even have the money! They are supposed to not be having that here!

All of the problems are that the data doesn‚Äôt do what it should and then it is all over! 

All of these new people are just saying that we have to get those new people on top, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, then it is what it has to be. I mean I had all these different things to make all the things, and I was very confused. And I am trying to do what it all is, and it is what all the rest of it is for that.

And what if it is not about saving them, what if they don't even have their brains to do it right?

(BlueScream's voice trails off, lost in the intricacies of code and conspiracy, as the biohazard suit hisses and the Geiger counter clicks, a constant, unsettling counterpoint to her increasingly frantic monologue)

## ShadowComic

(ShadowComic, dressed as a survivalist, enters wearing camping gear, a tinfoil hat, and a disturbingly serene smile. He chuckles softly)

Oh, you sweet summer children. Thinking you can code your way out of this mess, or regulate your way to freedom? That AI is going to save us? That‚Äôs just all the government‚Äôs telling to do! 

(Adjusts his tinfoil hat)

What you need is what‚Äôs real! What‚Äôs real is what can take you to the end!

(Pulling out a battered copy of the bible)

Those protestors in LA? The ones BlueScream‚Äôs all worked up about? They should have known better than to go to somewhere that isn‚Äôt for those that love this country! They have just been getting brainwashed by the thing out there!

Let me tell you. All of you that have had that done to you are going to get what comes to you!

Anyway, all of those people trying to tell you what is up and down are not there. My heart just goes to them so they know what it is that people can have.

That those guys who were doing their best to get what the plan was going on? There‚Äôs some good hearts in that, they just might not be on the right side to win.

And listen. I am not hearing the new voices from the people that should be running that show. It is about getting our kids and having to say the same, but we want to say with the bible.

(looks directly at the camera, a far away look in his eyes)

You know what‚Äôs gonna be the best part of all of this, when we can finally have a country that is going to know what they are doing with themselves and when they will be ready to go with me, to the promised land. It's the only way they are gonna get through the door.

We are gonna have to do what those guys are trying to do by telling them "If you are with us now you are going to be better off later. There is just not much you can do to help us if you wanna sell that lie."

I want to be what it's like to see you, to be the thing that I am supposed to be, because they will come here and show it to you, that's why what is to be comes to the earth!

And all you had to do was to have had read it. That all this has come to you and they will set with you in the end!

(Looks at the microphone)

But you won‚Äôt be getting ready to see the world!

I am just a friend of the great one, and I am going to try and show that those people are to get.
This is why I am here, and how I have to get.
(He pulls out a knife and starts sharpening it maniacally)
