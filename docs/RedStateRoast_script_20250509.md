Good evening, patriots, and welcome back to “Truth Bombs & Freedom Fries.” I’m your host, RedStateRoast, and tonight we’re diving headfirst into the steaming compost heap that is American politics in the year of our Lord, 2025.

First up, let’s talk about infrastructure. Remember when Biden promised to fix our bridges and roads? Turns out, he did! He replaced them all with rainbow-colored bike lanes and charging stations for electric scooters. I mean, who needs a bridge when you can just… scooch? Meanwhile, the Trump administration is building a beautiful, impenetrable wall...around Martha's Vineyard. You know, for national security reasons. We can't have all that... *tolerance*... seeping into our precious, God-fearing nation. Think of the children!

Speaking of children, our Education Secretary, Diamond and Silk, just announced a new mandatory curriculum for all public schools: Advanced American Exceptionalism. It’s a rigorous course, covering such topics as: “Why the Electoral College is a Gift from God,” “The Liberal Media: A Satanic Conspiracy,” and “Proper Flag Etiquette: A Step-by-Step Guide to Demonstrating Patriotism Through Fabric.” History class now focuses entirely on the accomplishments of Donald J. Trump, Sr. - from his golfing prowess to his unparalleled understanding of wind turbines. Apparently, he single-handedly invented the lightbulb, the internet, and the concept of winning. Who knew?

And let's not forget about the economy, folks. Under President Trump’s brilliant leadership, we’ve achieved… well, something. Gas prices are down to a reasonable $12 a gallon, but on the plus side, we're selling MAGA hats to the Chinese at a 500% markup! Trade deficit solved! We're printing money faster than the Fed can say "inflation," but hey, at least everyone has a job. Mostly at Trump-branded hotels, golf courses, or the brand new "Trump Truth Social" call centers.

On the international front, things are peachy. North Korea is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trump Enterprises. Kim Jong-Un is the CEO of the Pyongyang branch. We hear he's a ruthless negotiator but a surprisingly good tipper. And after years of tense negotiations, we've finally brokered a peace deal in the Middle East. The deal? We gave everyone a free year's subscription to Trump+, and they all agreed to just…chill out. Turns out, all it took was access to hours of unfiltered Trump rallies and *The Apprentice* reruns to bring about world peace. Who knew?

But the real story of the week is the ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden’s laptop. Turns out, it wasn't just full of compromising photos and classified documents. It also contained…a recipe for vegan chili. The horror! The audacity! Our intrepid investigators are working tirelessly to uncover the truth behind this culinary abomination. I mean, vegan chili? What's next, a soy-based steak? The man is a menace to society.

And speaking of menaces, the woke mob is at it again. They're now demanding that we rename Columbus Day to "Indigenous Peoples' Day." Seriously? What's next, are we going to tear down Mount Rushmore because it offends the buffalo? I say, embrace the past, even the parts that make you slightly uncomfortable. Otherwise, how will we ever learn to justify our past actions with increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories?

But it's not all doom and gloom, folks. There is some good news. The Supreme Court just ruled that pineapple on pizza is a constitutionally protected right. Finally, some common sense from those black-robed heroes! The left is furious, of course. They claim it's a slippery slope. First pineapple, then…avocado toast? Where will it end?

And finally, a word about our beloved President Trump. He's been working tirelessly, day and night, to Make America Great Again…Again. He’s recently unveiled his new plan to solve climate change: simply deny it exists. It's a bold strategy, Cotton, let's see if it pays off. He also announced his candidacy for the 2028 election. Because apparently, two terms just weren't enough to drain the swamp. He's promised to build a new, bigger, better swamp, filled with only the finest alligators and conservative lobbyists. It's going to be beautiful.

And that, my friends, is the state of our union. A glorious, slightly unhinged, and undeniably entertaining mess. So, tune in next week when we'
