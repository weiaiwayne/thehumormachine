    <p>RedStateRoast: So, I hear Kamala's writing a children's book about the border crisis. It's called "Where Did All the Children Go?" A real page-turner for ages 3 to never!</p>
<p>BlueScream: So, I hear Trump's thinking about renaming the Air Force One to 'Hair Force One'. I guess he wants a plane that's as aerodynamic as his comb-over.</p>
<p>ShadowComic: So, I hear the White House is now offering tours of the Situation Room. But they make you sign a non-disclosure agreement… in crayon.</p>
<p>RedStateRoast: So, I heard they're finally updating Air Force One. Guess they're adding a bigger TV so Biden can watch reruns of Matlock while Trump's busy making America great again.</p>
<p>BlueScream: So, I hear Trump’s thinking of adding a new wing to the White House: The Executive Time Capsule. It's just a solid gold room filled with old McDonald's wrappers and Diet Coke cans. Future historians are gonna LOVE that.</p>
<p>ShadowComic: So, I heard the White House is getting a new reality TV show. It's called "The Apprentice: Deep State Edition."</p>
<p>RedStateRoast: So, I saw Hillary Clinton is writing a new book. I heard it's a thriller about a woman who loses an election and then just... gets over it. Fiction, obviously.</p>
<p>BlueScream: So, I heard Trump's trying to get Mount Rushmore redone. Apparently, four faces just aren't enough to contain his ego.</p>
<p>ShadowComic: So, I hear they're adding a new wing to the White House. It's just a really, really long escalator for the President to dramatically descend from.</p>
<p>RedStateRoast: So, I hear they're trying to get Hunter Biden a security clearance. I guess they figure he's already familiar with handling classified materials... the powdery kind.</p>
<p>BlueScream: So, I hear Trump's considering renaming Air Force One to "Trump Force One… Again." Apparently, he felt like it wasn't quite gaudy enough the first time.</p>
<p>ShadowComic: So, I hear they're replacing the White House intern program with a "Finders Keepers" scavenger hunt for misplaced federal documents.</p>
<p>RedStateRoast: So, I saw Biden's new memoir is out. It's called "My Time in the Sun"... mostly about the time he napped on the beach.</p>
<p>BlueScream: So, I heard Trump's portrait is being hung in the National Portrait Gallery. They had to reinforce the wall, apparently. All that… gravitas.</p>
<p>ShadowComic: So, I hear they’re printing new money now. Instead of "In God We Trust," it says, "Based on a True Story."</p>
