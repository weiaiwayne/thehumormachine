Good evening, patriots, and welcome back to "Truth Bombs From the Right." I’m RedStateRoast, and I’m here to tell you what the mainstream media won’t: that we’re winning. Bigly.

(Raises an eyebrow, pauses for audience reaction)

Yes, I know, some of you liberals are still clutching your pearls, convinced that Trump's triumphant return was just a bad dream after too much kombucha. Well, wake up and smell the MAGA-flavored coffee. It's brewing, and it's strong.

Speaking of strong, have you seen our First Lady lately? Melania's back, and she’s traded in her "I Really Don't Care, Do U?" jacket for an "I Really Do Care, About America Winning" one. It’s bedazzled, of course. Priorities.

But let’s get down to brass tacks. The economy is booming, or at least, that's what my accountant tells me after I send him my taxes. Inflation is… uh… well, it's definitely happening, but we're calling it "patriotic pricing" now. It’s like a surcharge for being American. You're welcome.

And don’t even get me started on the border. Remember all those sob stories about "families fleeing persecution"? Turns out, they were just fleeing the opportunity to work hard and pay taxes like the rest of us. We’ve replaced the border wall with a giant trampoline. Keeps the illegals out, and provides hours of entertainment for border patrol. It’s a win-win.

(Leans forward conspiratorially)

But the real story, the one the Deep State doesn't want you to hear, is about the woke mind virus. It's still out there, folks, lurking in college campuses and Hollywood studios. But don’t worry, we’re fighting back. Secretary of Education, Kid Rock, is working tirelessly to de-woke our schools. His new curriculum involves mandatory banjo lessons and a deep dive into the lyrics of "Bawitdaba." Finally, some real education.

And Hollywood? Well, let’s just say that the only thing more predictable than a Marvel movie is the outrage that follows when we cast a white actor as a historically accurate white character. But we’re winning that battle too. The new "Avengers" movie features an all-American, God-fearing superhero named Captain Capitalism. His superpower? Tax cuts.

(Rolls eyes dramatically)

Meanwhile, the Democrats are still trying to figure out what went wrong. They’re blaming everything: Russian bots, voter suppression, the electoral college… anything but their own terrible ideas. They’ve even started accusing Trump of using… wait for it… *reverse psychology* to win over voters. As if the man who tweets everything that comes into his head has the strategic genius of Sun Tzu. Please.

But here’s the real kicker. The Democrats have a new strategy: they’re trying to appeal to… *wait for it*… *rural voters*. They’re sending Kamala Harris to Iowa to talk about… *wait for it*… *the importance of tractors*. I’m not making this up. I’m pretty sure she thinks a combine is a dating app for farmers.

(Shakes head in mock disbelief)

And speaking of dating, have you heard about the new dating app for conservatives? It’s called "MAGAmatch." It’s just like Tinder, but instead of swiping left on anyone who mentions pronouns, you swipe right on anyone who owns a gun and knows the words to the Star-Spangled Banner. First date idea? A rally, of course.

But seriously, folks, despite all the craziness, there’s a lot to be optimistic about. We’re building a better America, one tweet at a time. We’re making America great again, again. And we’re doing it all while triggering the libs.

(Winks at the camera)

Now, I know some of you are thinking, "RedStateRoast, aren’t you worried that all this divisiveness is tearing the country apart?" And to that I say: yes. Absolutely. But hey, at least we’re having fun.

And that’s the truth, folks. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go practice my golf swing. The President invited me to Mar-a-Lago this weekend. He said he needs someone to blame for his bad putts.

**(Raises a glass of something amber colored)**

To America! May she always be great, and may her enemies always be triggered.
