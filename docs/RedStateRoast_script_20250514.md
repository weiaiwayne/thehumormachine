Alright, alright, settle down, folks. You all look like you just found out Hunter Biden’s been appointed head of the DEA. Which, knowing this administration, is entirely plausible.

Speaking of our esteemed President… Trump held a rally in Iowa yesterday. Said he was there to support the farmers. You know, the salt of the earth, the backbone of America. Then he spent 45 minutes talking about how windmills cause cancer in bald eagles and how he personally invented corn.

Apparently, nobody had the heart to tell him that the Iowa caucuses are over. Bless his heart. He’s like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it already caught.

But hey, at least he’s consistent. Consistent in his… let’s call it “alternative accounting” of reality. Remember when he promised to drain the swamp? Now it’s more like he built a water park in it. With a lifetime pass for the swamp creatures.

And the economy! Oh, the economy. Inflation’s so high, I saw a homeless guy turn down a nickel. He said, “Nah, I’m holding out for a dime. Gotta diversify my portfolio.”

But don't worry, Janet Yellen's on it. She just announced a new initiative to combat inflation: "Positive Vibes and Manifestation." I'm not making that up. I swear, I almost choked on my artisanal, organically-sourced, gluten-free, non-GMO, freedom-loving bullet coffee when I heard that.

Meanwhile, Congress is gridlocked tighter than a Kardashian's corset. The Democrats are still investigating Trump. The Republicans are still investigating Hillary. And I'm starting to think both sides are just running out the clock until they can retire and collect their sweet, sweet government pensions.

Speaking of retirements, remember Kamala Harris? She's "transitioned" into a full-time influencer. Apparently, her "authentic" content isn't resonating, because her latest sponsored post was for a line of camouflage Crocs. I'm not sure who she's trying to appeal to, but it's definitely not the fashion-forward.

And then there’s the culture wars. Oh, the culture wars. They’re raging on like a dumpster fire fueled by social media outrage. Woke is still the boogeyman, cancel culture is still the enemy, and pronouns are still… well, pronouns are still pronouns. Unless you’re on TikTok, then they’re a political statement.

I saw a headline the other day that said, “Gen Z Declares War on the Oxford Comma.” I swear, I almost joined them. That thing is a menace. But then I realized, if Gen Z is fighting the Oxford comma, who’s going to fight the real enemies, like… avocado toast?

And let's not forget about foreign policy. Biden's trip to Europe was a real success. He managed to offend the French, confuse the Germans, and accidentally declare war on Luxembourg. All in a three-day weekend.

Meanwhile, China is building islands in the South China Sea faster than I can build a wall out of MAGA hats. And Russia is… well, Russia is still doing whatever Russia does. Which, as far as I can tell, involves shirtless horseback riding and hacking our elections.

But hey, at least we're united here at home. United in our… frustration. United in our… cynicism. United in our… shared Netflix password.

Seriously, though, folks, what are we doing? We're arguing about pronouns and avocado toast while the world is literally on fire. We're so busy hating each other that we've forgotten what it means to be Americans.

We need to get our act together. We need to stop listening to the talking heads and start talking to each other. We need to remember that we're all in this together, even if half of us are wrong. (Beat. Smiles wryly.) Just kidding!

But seriously, we need to find some common ground. We need to rediscover our sense of humor. We need to remember that politics is just a game, and that life is too short to be angry all the time.

So, let’s all take a deep breath, crack open a cold one (preferably a Bud Light, just to trigger the libs), and remember that tomorrow is another day. And who knows? Maybe tomorrow, Hunter Biden will actually get nominated as head of the DEA.

(Pauses for laughter, then leans into the microphone.)

Stay tuned, folks. It’s going to be a wild ride.
