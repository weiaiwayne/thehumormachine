Alright, settle down, you beautiful basket cases. Let’s dissect the… *gestures grandly* …state of things, shall we? It’s like a Jackson Pollock painting made of pure, unadulterated chaos.

So, Trump’s domestic policy bill – the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” or as I prefer to call it, the “Billionaire Bailout Bonanza” – passed the House. By one vote! That’s right, democracy almost functioned. Almost. It was like watching a toddler try to defuse a bomb. Close, but ultimately, someone's gonna get messy.

The bill is now heading to the Senate, where it will either be passed, filibustered into oblivion, or, most likely, used as a weapon in a bizarre TikTok dance challenge. Stay tuned!

What’s in this so-called bill? Oh, you know, the usual: tax cuts for the wealthy, cuts to Medicaid (because poor people simply *must* stop being so unhealthy, it’s bad for the stock market), and, of course, a provision that effectively neuters the Supreme Court. Apparently, checks and balances are now considered a “liberal conspiracy.” Who knew?

See, the bill contains a sneaky little clause that says courts can’t use appropriated funds to enforce contempt citations if no security was given. Which, in layman’s terms, means Trump can ignore court orders with impunity. It’s like giving a toddler a nuclear football because, hey, they *look* like they know what they’re doing.

And I love the justifications being thrown around. “Oh, we’re just streamlining the government.” “We’re cutting wasteful spending.” Sure, because the best way to save money is to let the President do whatever he wants, consequences be damned. It’s fiscal responsibility, folks! Just ask Marie Antoinette.

And then there’s the small matter of Trump’s “crypto dinner.” Apparently, if you buy enough of his commemorative meme coins – and I use the word “invest” loosely, unless you’re investing in future regret – you get to dine with the President. For a mere million dollars a plate! It’s like a charity gala, except instead of supporting a good cause, you’re just… *gestures vaguely* … supporting Trump. It's basically legalized bribery, but with blockchain!

I can just imagine the conversation at that dinner. “So, Mr. President, about those regulations…” *wink, wink*. “Oh, don’t worry, I’ll equalize things.” *another wink, slightly more menacing*.

And speaking of “equalizing,” Trump apparently thinks he invented the word. Yes, “equalizing.” As in, “evening the score,” “making things fair,” you know, the concept that’s been around since… well, since people started unequalizing things. The man’s vocabulary is a linguistic black hole, sucking in all knowledge and spitting out… *gestures dismissively* … this.

Meanwhile, the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, came to the White House and, in a moment of truly inspired trolling, told Trump he didn’t have a plane to give him. To which Trump, like a petulant child, replied, “I wish you did.” Folks, we are being governed by a toddler with the nuclear codes and a penchant for shiny objects.

And just to sprinkle some extra crazy on top, Trump is now using photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo to prove there’s a “white genocide” in South Africa. It’s like a game of global Mad Libs, where the answers are always racist, misinformed, and utterly baffling.

And let’s not forget the “Trump Accounts” for newborns. Because nothing says “Welcome to the world!” like saddling a baby with the legacy of Trumpism. It's a great way to indoctrinate kids early.

Finally, it seems the Treasury is putting an end to penny production. Which, honestly, is the most sensible thing this administration has done so far. I mean, who even *uses* pennies anymore? They’re basically tiny copper reminders of our collective economic misery. Plus, now they’re going to be the price of memecoins!

So, yeah. That’s the news. We’re living in a clown show directed by a megalomaniac, written by a team of rabid squirrels, and scored by a kazoo orchestra. But hey, at least it’s never boring.
