Alright, alright, settle down, you beautiful, patriotic messes. Let’s dive headfirst into the swamp. Because if you’re not neck-deep in alligators and conspiracy theories, are you even *living*?

So, this week in Washington, it seems President Trump is having a bit of a… well, let’s call it an “existential tariff-tantrum.” Wall Street, bless their cold, calculating hearts, has coined a new acronym: TACO. Trump Always Chickens Out. Which, I gotta admit, is catchier than anything the Democrats have come up with since “Hope and Change.” I mean, “Building Back Better”? Sounds like a construction project gone horribly wrong.

Now, Trump is *not* happy about being called a TACO. Apparently, “nasty questions” about his flip-flopping on trade are now punishable by… well, probably just a strongly worded tweet and maybe a drone strike on a CNN bureau.

But folks, let’s be real. This TACO situation is a win-win for everyone. Trump gets to bluster and threaten, Wall Street gets to make a killing playing the market, and I get to work “TACO” into as many jokes as humanly possible. It’s the American dream, folks.

And speaking of dreams, JD Vance, our esteemed Vice President and resident Hillbilly Elegy enthusiast, is now fully embracing the crypto craze. He told a Bitcoin conference that crypto finally has a “champion” in the White House. Which is great news for all those Bitcoin millionaires… and potentially terrible news for anyone who still thinks tulip bulbs are a sound investment strategy.

Apparently the administration thinks Bitcoin is a 'movement'. A movement, I say. A movement of nerds who are all going to be rug-pulled, sent to the poorhouse and left to cry on Reddit. I am ready for this.

Meanwhile, Marco Rubio is back in the news, aggressively revoking student visas from Chinese students. Apparently, learning is now a national security threat. I guess all those late-night study sessions are just a cover for… what, exactly? Stealing our precious bodily fluids formula? I'm sure Little Marco just wants Barron to have a better chance of getting into Harvard in the future.

And speaking of Harvard, President Trump is threatening to pull *three billion dollars* in federal funding. Because what better way to “Make America Great Again” than by crippling our top universities? I’m sure the Kremlin is just *thrilled* with this development. Nothing says America is back like a bunch of uneducated, underfunded universities.

Then there is news that our Secretary of Education wants Harvard to be more “in sync” with Trump’s agenda. Which, I guess, means offering courses on “Advanced Golf Etiquette” and “The Art of the Deal…ing with Multiple Indictments.”

Oh, and lest we forget, the Pentagon is diverting a *billion dollars* from Army barracks to fund the border mission. I guess soldiers can just sleep on the sand. It’s character building! Builds grit and determination. Besides, who needs a decent barracks when you can have a slightly taller wall? It is probably the same contractors building the wall as the barracks.

Meanwhile, the DOJ is charging one of our Congresspeople for protesting ICE. I can just picture the scene. Someone from Texas getting arrested at a demonstration? For a group of federal agents, it must have been like capturing a unicorn. I'm just saying that is a brave soul to go against the regime.

And let’s not forget the latest from Texas, where they’re now requiring the Ten Commandments in public schools. I guess the separation of church and state is now considered a “woke” ideology. Next thing you know, they’ll be teaching creationism alongside evolution and offering a course on “How to Stone Your Adulterous Neighbor.” It’s called "Texas: We're not a Cult"

Finally, the most unholy of all news is that RFK Jr's people are now trying to restrict government scientists from publishing in the top medical journals. I guess this will be a new series of public health crises we can call the "Wormhole Epoch". I'm sure that is not a coincidence. Everything is connected.

But hey, at least we're not boring, right? So, to all my fellow patriots, stay strong, stay informed, and remember, when the world goes completely bonkers, just put on your MAGA hat, grab a six-pack, and laugh. Because if we don’t laugh, we’ll cry. And nobody wants to see a grown man in a MAGA hat crying. It’s just… unsettling.
