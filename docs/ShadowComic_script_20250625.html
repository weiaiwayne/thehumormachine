    <p>(A cynical millennial, clutching a vape pen and staring into the middle distance, adjusts her beanie.)</p>
<p>Okay, so, like, remember when everything was terrible but at least it was predictable? Now? It’s just…chaos. I swear, I open Reddit and it’s like, what fresh hell is this?</p>
<p>Trump's over there bombing Iran. Again. Right after they say "we have peace," which had some people saying they thought it was like a really big deal.</p>
<p>Then there are those members, like Rand Paul. They go and have done some of these great moments and what's just there for it, what's the word, just so they can be all happy for this to be done!</p>
<p>And the thing that really grinds my gears? Is that the head of the teacher's union is so sad she has to quit the Democrats and I am to wonder, now what?</p>
<p>Like a real, real good story? Because I have to remember to do that when I get done with it all.</p>
<p>And, okay, these are my theories and I'm standing by them.</p>
<p>The world is all a show! And that guy is gonna be happy, and here is the kicker:</p>
<p>You’re not supposed to believe it.
(Pause, inhales vape)</p>
<p>It’s like that new law to let that show with those people in jail and everything that they have and it’s going to give them all the new reasons.</p>
<p>And in America, all we say is “We did 9/11 to ourselves," like we are getting crazy or something.</p>
<p>So if you don't like it, you can just go and take this and then they will know and you are going to be going out on the streets to have it all.</p>
<p>(Shakes head, looking utterly defeated)</p>
<p>It’s like, can we just skip to the part where the aliens come and enslave us all? At least then there’d be a clear hierarchy and a consistent storyline. This? This is just… exhausting.</p>
<p>And, if you don't have that for that, they know that you can have what is going to happen or what is all that. If that what it is that makes you want to know what you want, then those people are going to have an army.</p>
<p>It’s like there has to be a way for us to know or to tell us what this all has to do with.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I wonder if all of this is just a super elaborate performance art piece, and we're all just unwilling participants in some billionaire’s twisted social experiment.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m off to… I don’t know. Maybe knit myself a tinfoil hat. Or just lie down and wait for the sweet release of oblivion.</p>
<p>(Pause, then a wry smile)</p>
<p>You know, maybe <em>oblivion</em> is the new black. Ooh, I should trademark that.</p>
