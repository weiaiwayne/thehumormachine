**(Opening music fades, applause, BlueScream strides confidently to center stage. He's wearing a subtly ripped, designer blazer and a weary, yet amused expression.)**

**BlueScream:** Welcome back, folks. Or, as I like to call it these days, "Welcome back to the Republic of Perpetual Disbelief." I’m BlueScream, and I'm still not entirely sure if I’m dreaming. But if I am, someone needs to seriously upgrade the graphics card. This is some low-resolution dystopia we're living in.

So, yeah, another four years. Or, as my therapist refers to it, “another four years of job security.” I mean, you gotta hand it to the guy. He’s like a political cockroach. You can nuke the entire planet, and he’ll be there afterwards, tweeting about how he personally negotiated the post-apocalyptic peace treaty.

And the Cabinet! Oh, the Cabinet. It’s like someone raided a Spirit Halloween store, but instead of costumes, they just filled it with people who actively hate the departments they’re supposed to be running. The new Secretary of Education thinks books are a communist plot. The Secretary of Energy is convinced fossil fuels are powered by the tears of liberals. And the Secretary of… well, look, I can’t even *say* what the Secretary of Homeland Security believes on television. Let’s just say it involves lizard people and a very concerning fondness for tinfoil.

(Pause for laughter, sips water)

But, hey, at least gas prices are down. Mostly because nobody can afford to drive anywhere. You know, with the inflation rate rivaling the speed of light and the average American family now subsisting on ramen noodles and conspiracy theories. It’s a real renaissance of culinary… desperation.

Speaking of which, I saw a headline the other day that nearly made me choke on my government-subsidized cricket protein bar. Apparently, the new White House initiative to combat climate change involves… wait for it… *planting more trees*.

(Deadpan stare)

Groundbreaking. Absolutely revolutionary. I mean, who needs scientific research, international cooperation, or a fundamental shift in our energy consumption when we can just… plant trees? It’s like trying to put out a raging inferno with a water pistol. But hey, at least it looks good on Instagram. Which, let’s be honest, is the only thing that actually matters anymore.

And the culture wars! Don’t even get me started. It’s like the 1950s decided to time travel to 2025, got a bad case of internet poisoning, and then started demanding that everyone wear poodle skirts and denounce critical race theory. Which, ironically, most of them can’t even define. It’s all just a big, angry, performative outrage machine, fueled by clickbait and the collective anxiety of a nation that’s slowly realizing its best days are behind it.

(Leans into the microphone)

But you know what really gets me? The hypocrisy. The sheer, unadulterated, industrial-strength hypocrisy. The same people who scream about "freedom" are the first ones to demand censorship. The same people who preach "personal responsibility" are the first ones to blame everyone else for their problems. The same people who claim to be "pro-life" are the first ones to cut funding for prenatal care and social services. It’s like living in a Bizarro World episode written by a team of toddlers on meth.

(Paces the stage)

And the media! Oh, the media. It’s a goddamn circus. You’ve got one side peddling blatant propaganda, the other side hyperventilating about the end of democracy, and nobody, *nobody*, actually reporting the goddamn news. It’s all just noise. A cacophony of partisan screeching designed to keep us divided, distracted, and perpetually terrified. Which, I guess, is working. Because I’m terrified.

But hey, at least we have memes. I mean, what else are we supposed to do? Laugh? Cry? Organize a revolution? Nah. We’re Americans. We’re too busy arguing about whether pineapple belongs on pizza to overthrow a corrupt government. Which, come to think of it, might be the real conspiracy.

(Smirks)

So, yeah. That’s where we are. Living in a world where up is down, right is wrong, and the only thing that makes sense is the crippling sense of existential dread. But hey, at least we’re all in this together. Right?

(Looks directly at the camera, a hint of desperation in his eyes)

…Right?

(Music swells, BlueScream shrugs, walks off stage. The screen cuts to a montage of increasingly absurd news headlines, set to
