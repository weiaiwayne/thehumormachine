**(Opening music fades. BlueScream stands center stage, a single spotlight illuminating him. He's dressed in a slightly-too-tight suit, the tie askew.)**

Good evening, America. Or, as it’s more accurately becoming known, America 2: Electric Boogaloo. And by “electric,” I mean powered by coal, blessed by prayer, and terrified by anything remotely resembling progress.

**(He takes a sip from a mug that reads "Covfefe: Now With More Covfefe")**

So, yeah, *he’s* back. The man, the myth, the orange… thing. Donald Trump. I swear, sometimes I think history is just a really long, elaborate Rickroll. You think you’re getting closer to the punchline, and BAM! Suddenly, you’re back in 2017, only this time, your therapist charges double.

And what a glorious return it's been! It’s like watching a toddler learn to ride a bicycle, except the bicycle is the US government, the toddler has access to nuclear launch codes, and the training wheels are made of pure, unadulterated grievance.

**(He gestures to a screen behind him, which displays a mock-up of a Trump rally, complete with pixelated American flags and a crowd of bobbleheads.)**

Remember the rallies? Oh, they’re back, baby! Bigger, louder, and somehow even more… beige. I mean, the man could endorse a beige-colored rock and it would instantly become the hottest commodity on Wall Street. “Introducing the Trump Pebble™! Guaranteed to… well, sit there. But it’s *your* rock. And it’s MAGA-fied!”

And the policies! Oh, the policies! It’s like someone gave a chimpanzee a box of crayons and told him to redraw the Constitution. Except the chimpanzee is also convinced he’s a stable genius and the crayons are dipped in lead paint.

We've got the new Space Force initiative, which now requires all astronauts to wear red hats and declare their unwavering loyalty to the Trump brand before liftoff. Failure to comply results in immediate reassignment… to Mars. Without a return ticket. Apparently, “Make Mars Great Again” is the new frontier. I just hope they brought enough sunscreen.

Then there's the "Education Reform" act, which mandates that all history textbooks be rewritten to accurately reflect the President's accomplishments. I've seen a draft. Turns out, he single-handedly won the Revolutionary War, invented the internet, and taught Einstein everything he knew. Also, he’s apparently a direct descendant of King Arthur. Makes sense.

**(He pauses, staring blankly at the camera.)**

You know, I used to think that satire was dead. That reality had become so absurd, it was impossible to parody. I was wrong. Reality is just giving us raw material. Like a dog regurgitating its kibble onto your living room rug. It’s disgusting, but hey, at least you’ve got something to work with.

Speaking of dogs, the new Attorney General, Baron Trump (yes, really), has declared that all dogs must now be registered as emotional support animals for the President. This is apparently to combat the "deep state canine conspiracy" he believes is plotting against him. I’m not making this up. I wish I was. My therapist wishes I was.

And the media! Oh, the media! It’s a never-ending game of Whac-A-Mole, except the moles are conspiracy theories, and the hammer is a fact-checker with severe carpal tunnel syndrome. CNN is now officially designated as "Enemy of the People Network," and Fox News has been renamed "Trump News Channel: All Trump, All the Time." Even the Weather Channel now has a segment dedicated to predicting the President's mood based on the barometric pressure in Mar-a-Lago.

**(He sighs, running a hand through his hair.)**

Look, I get it. It’s exhausting. It’s demoralizing. It’s like living in a perpetual episode of *The Twilight Zone*, directed by a committee of angry hamsters. But we can’t give up. We can’t let them win. We have to keep fighting… with humor. Because, let’s be honest, what else do we have?

**(He leans into the microphone, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.)**

I heard a rumor… a whisper… that the Democrats are planning a new strategy. Apparently, they’re going to try… reason. Yeah, I know. Sounds crazy, right? Like bringing a Nerf gun to a nuclear war. But hey, you never know. Maybe, just maybe, if we’re persistent enough, if we’re loud enough, if we’re funny enough… we
