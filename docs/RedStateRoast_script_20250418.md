Evening, patriots! Or, as I like to call you – the last bastion of common sense in a nation gone cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

So, another week, another dumpster fire lit by the Left. Though, I gotta say, this dumpster is getting pretty cozy. I’m starting to think they’re *intentionally* making it habitable for their socialist utopia. Remember when they said Trump was going to destroy democracy? Turns out, they just wanted to get a head start.

Speaking of utopias, did you hear about the new initiative in Portland? They’re replacing police officers with interpretive dancers. Apparently, aggressive ballet is more effective than pepper spray at dispersing Antifa riots. I mean, who’s gonna throw a Molotov cocktail at a pirouetting dude in tights? Nobody, that's who. The problem is, when the interpretive dancers start looting the stores themselves, who's gonna stop them?

And Biden, bless his heart, is still out there… somewhere. Last week he unveiled his new plan to combat inflation: a national "Hug a Banker" day. He genuinely believes that if we all just show enough affection to the people who control our money, they'll magically lower interest rates out of the goodness of their hearts. Folks, I've seen more strategic thinking from a squirrel trying to cross a highway. But hey, at least he’s hugging *bankers* now. Remember when he was hugging children? Yeah, that was a weird time.

But the real story, the one they don’t want you to hear, is what’s happening with our beloved electric vehicles. Remember when they promised us a future of silent, emissions-free driving? Well, turns out, those electric cars are about as reliable as Hunter Biden at a spelling bee. I saw a headline the other day that said, "EV Owners Stranded in Blizzard, Blame Biden." I thought, "Well, duh." It's not like the blizzard was gonna admit fault.

And the charging stations? Don't even get me started. They’re about as common as a conservative professor on a college campus. You gotta plan your road trip like you're Lewis and Clark searching for the Northwest Passage. Except instead of dysentery, you're facing the existential dread of your battery dying in the middle of nowhere with your woke kids whining about the lack of Wi-Fi.

But the best part? Turns out, the mines that produce the lithium for these batteries are destroying the environment at a rate that makes a fracking operation look like a butterfly sanctuary. So, we’re saving the planet by destroying the planet. Makes perfect sense. It’s the kind of logic that only a coastal elite sipping a soy latte while lecturing you about your carbon footprint could come up with.

And speaking of woke elites, have you seen what they’re doing to our schools? They’re teaching our kids that America is evil, that capitalism is oppressive, and that gender is a social construct. I swear, if I hear one more kid tell me they identify as a non-binary attack helicopter, I’m gonna lose it.

Look, I’m all for tolerance, but there’s a difference between tolerance and lunacy. We're not teaching our kids math, science, or history anymore. We're teaching them how to virtue signal and pronouns. And then they wonder why they can't find a job when they graduate. I mean, what employer is going to hire someone who's triggered by the word "he" but can't balance a checkbook?

But don’t worry, folks. The Trump administration has a plan. We’re going to Make America Sane Again. We’re going to drain the swamp, build the wall (again!), and bring back common sense to this country. And we're going to do it all while triggering the libs so hard they spontaneously combust.

And the media? Oh, the media. They're still trying to figure out how Trump managed to get re-elected. They keep saying it's because of Russian interference. Which is hilarious, because I haven't seen the Russians this incompetent since the invasion of Ukraine. It's like they're actively *trying* to lose. Maybe they’re going woke too. Who knows?

But let's be honest, the media isn't interested in reporting the truth. They're interested in pushing their agenda. They're the propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. They're the reason why your aunt still believes that Trump is a racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic… well, you get the idea. And they're wrong.

But here's the thing: we're not going to let them win. We're
