**(Opening music fades, camera focuses on BlueScream, standing center stage, casually leaning on a desk littered with crumpled newspapers and half-eaten energy bars.)**

**BlueScream:** Welcome back, folks. It’s me, BlueScream, your nightly dose of existential dread wrapped in a thin veneer of amusement. I hope you all enjoyed your government-mandated hour of meditation and patriotic affirmations. Remember, negativity is un-American! Unless, of course, it’s directed at the right targets, which, coincidentally, are conveniently listed on the Department of Truth's website. Check it out. It's a real page-turner. Especially the section on "Unpatriotic Thoughts," categorized alphabetically. Today, I'm working my way through "N." Apparently, "Nostalgia for a Time When We Weren't Controlled by Algorithms" is a gateway drug to sedition. Who knew?

**(Sighs dramatically)**

Speaking of things we probably shouldn’t remember, let’s talk about the Elephant back in the room. No, not the actual elephant. Those are now strictly regulated and require a permit to even *think* about. I’m talking about the *other* Elephant, the one currently residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Donald J. Trump, back for his encore. Or is it a reboot? A sequel nobody asked for? I can't keep track anymore. It's like the Fast and Furious franchise, except instead of cars, it's democracy careening off a cliff.

**(Gestures vaguely)**

The man’s back, baby! And he’s… well, he’s doing Trump things. Tweeting at 3 AM about the Deep State’s obsession with his tan, declaring war on pigeons – apparently they’re “feathered informants” – and, of course, promising to make America great… again. It’s like a time machine powered by pure, unadulterated ego. I honestly thought we'd reached peak absurdity during his first term, but apparently the human capacity for the ridiculous is boundless. Like a bottomless mimosa brunch, but instead of champagne, it's political chaos.

And his supporters? God bless 'em. They’re out there, still waving their flags, still chanting slogans that sound suspiciously like Mad Libs written by QAnon. They’re the real MVPs of this whole tragicomedy. They’ve managed to convince themselves that the last four years were all a dream, and that we're now living in some sort of alternate reality where… well, where Donald Trump is a stable genius. I guess if you repeat something enough times, it becomes the truth. Just ask Goebbels. Oh wait, you can't.

**(Leans into the microphone conspiratorially)**

You know, I heard a rumor – totally unsubstantiated, of course, so don’t quote me on this – that the White House is now powered entirely by the tears of liberals. Sustainable energy, folks! It's genius, really. We’re simultaneously saving the planet and fueling the Trump agenda. Talk about a win-win. For Trump, anyway.

**(Straightens up, adopts a more serious tone)**

But let’s not pretend this is all just harmless buffoonery. The appointments are rolling in. Betsy DeVos is now Secretary of… well, she's in charge of something. Nobody's quite sure what. Probably privatizing air. And Rudy Giuliani? He's the Attorney General. I’m not even kidding. The man who once held press conferences in front of landscaping companies is now in charge of the Justice Department. It’s like putting a toddler in charge of nuclear codes. What could possibly go wrong?

**(Paces the stage)**

The media, of course, is doing its best. Fox News is still diligently reporting that everything is awesome, MSNBC is still having on panels of increasingly exasperated experts, and CNN… well, CNN is still trying to figure out how to be both fair and balanced while simultaneously acknowledging that the President is actively undermining democracy. It’s a tough gig. I admire their tenacity. They're like Sisyphus, except instead of pushing a boulder up a hill, they're trying to make sense of Trump's tweets.

**(Shakes head)**

And Congress? Oh, Congress. They’re… well, they’re mostly just tweeting. Lots and lots of tweeting. About how outraged they are. About how they’re going to fight back. About how they’re going to… do something. Eventually. Maybe. After their next fundraising dinner. Sponsored by Big Pharma.

**(Sighs again)**

So, where does that leave us? Well, folks, we're living in interesting times. That’s the polite way of putting it. The less polite way is…
