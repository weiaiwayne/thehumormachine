Okay, so, another day, another reminder that we’re basically living in a choose-your-own-apocalypse novel, except all the choices lead to, well, *this*. 

You know, I was just reading this article about how the Supreme Court is all good for what Trump's doing to this show with everything with the new show coming on. And like, what’s even worse is that all the people are just mad about the people are trying to be on that. That’s, you know, a little bit of a lot!

It's just that where is all of that anyway? They have so few rules and we get all those numbers in all those days.
(takes a sip of beer). But to get them to say that is so wrong! I don’t even.

I thought to myself what is all that all about? And then I saw on my computer this all saying that, and that's so crazy that this is making them do that.

(Looks directly at the camera)

So the real lesson here, my friends, is that you need to be doing all the things, and stop buying clothes, stop eating a lot, don't have kids because the things that need to be good are gone.

And all those people that the new people that did what those are for, what did they actually do to the rest of those what have to be over there? Oh, and to be getting to the point is like if you could see their hearts what would they really do?

I’m going to do is say to you all, this is what I do.

(Adjusts his glasses, a faraway look in his eyes)

It just gets more and more weird! Remember what I said about the show. It is going to get good. But if you say what do is not to be for all of this then don't. Do what I need to, and what what what is to be what it looks like!
I say it here I'm just saying that it has been said before and will have to say it before and you all have had to help all of it!

Thanks!

Post: As Trump lays out draconian plan to deal with migrants, rights groups raise alarm

Top Comments:
- > If reelected, Trump said he will order the military to carry out mass deportations, end birthright citizenship, bar entry for people from countries with “violent” ideologies, and set up ideological screening for all immigrants

Wow, it’s like he’s trying to turn the US into something worse than nazi Germany.
- "Countries with 'violent' ideologies" = countries with a majority of brown people.
- It wasn’t that long ago that the GOP claimed that you couldn’t be a Christian and a Democrat. Hypocrisy is their bread and butter.
- But I thought that was a Biden-Harris plan.
- >*Countries with violent ideologies*

So...america?
- He’s going to claim that we don’t need laws anymore to protect his border. That he can use drones and mines to do it without breaking the law.
- Sounds like he wants to copy the Israeli playbook.
- Isn't there some country that's already a master at building walls and discriminating against the "others" that they could model this plan after? Hmmm 🤔
- "The final solution to the immigration problem."

I bet they didn't even think about that but that is definitely what that sounds like.
- This is all legal. The only thing he can't do is get away with it, and that's the trick.
- So when he fails we can blame him like he did with Obama?
- Wow, I am shocked he has more ideas for how to hurt people.

Has no one ever seen the first Terminator film?
- How many promises of "better" healthcare, infrastructure, and border security has he made? All of them hollow.
- >he will order the military to carry out mass deportations, end birthright citizenship, bar entry for people from countries with “violent” ideologies, and set up ideological screening for all immigrants

Is this before or after martial law is declared?
- How's that "good economy" working out for you, Boomers, Gen X'ers, and older Millennials?

You voted for this again.
- > The Constitution doesn’t apply to people we don’t like!

— Trump, probably
- > and set up ideological screening for all immigrants.

So... no one in favor of democracy or freedom?
- *The military will carry out mass deportations*

*Bar entry for people from countries with “violent” ideologies*

*Set up ideological screening for all immigrants*

These are the words of a fascist. If you support this, you are a fascist
- You know that's a lot of money you're promising to rich private companies
- “Countries with ‘violent’ ideologies,” code for “black and brown countries.”
- Can't be an invasion, if it's done by our own military.
