## RedStateRoast

(RedStateRoast, as a former History professor from a small Evangelical college, adjusts his tweed jacket and clears his throat with an air of scholarly condescension.)

Now, now, settle down folks, let’s bring a little intellectual rigor to this… this *carnival of the absurd*. All this talk of “Q drops” and “lizard people” is a distraction from the *real* threat.

You all saw what happened in that one guy! He must be from the new world and they are trying to take them down!

But I came here to listen:

We need to make to be better, but as I was to know this new thing this year, it has gotten us the new way to make sure they can! I'm just not so sure how they can say they love God and not be a part of that.

You know, I can’t help but see parallels to the decline of the Roman Republic. The bread and circuses, the moral decay, the… the rampant social media use among the youth! It’s all there in Cicero, just waiting for you to read it with the right eye!

Now, what was that you were saying about the world and how did what comes here to the things. I have to hear it! And I will tell you now, there are gonna be things. 

(He pauses, adjusts his glasses.)

I know the people who had said for the way. Well I don’t know what these fellas are even saying anymore! If you had the money, or if you had the government, then that would be so crazy that I would laugh my head clean off!

What happens to be true, as has been known in the great of times. Is that there must be something to tell us about what is to come from the place, to the great, to what is this world.

But this mess is not a new one! Did you read that there was someone who was wrong? I did, you just had to look it up!

(He leans in conspiratorially.)

But here is what is going to come, in the middle they will tell you that this is what we do, and what does happen will be with more! Oh my, so much so the bad has said “There is so much to make me feel.” So listen, listen to what’s out there, not what's here.

This is just a waste of time.

And you know that in Texas they say about everything is about to be the key that happens to the place as bad? Well, why do you want it?

If that's how you want to make the case, so much will know it and you are just what’s been going on.

Oh what do you tell you to trust and have the faith that it will all be what?

Let’s be real folks, the whole system is rigged. You just have to look at the old code, so you all see it. Now tell it to all that it’s from the government and I will see you all where and all to what I'm sure to see in life all the things will come for me and just to know is that all I need with it.

## BlueScream

(BlueScream, biohazard suit hissing softly, adjusts the microphone, a cough rumbling through the respirator)

Okay, okay, okay, so RedStateRoast is talking about, like, Cicero and the decline of the Roman Republic, and that crystal lady is looking for my soul. But you wanna know what they both miss?

It's the *infrastructure*, guys. It's always the freakin’ infrastructure!

You know, the roads are all crumbling everywhere, and then all I did was just think about the problems. It’s like all the pieces that the aliens want and you can’t do anymore.

(She pauses, fiddling with a dial on her respirator, a faraway look in her eyes)

I mean, think about it. The Roman Republic, they had their aqueducts, their roads. Now what do we have? The internet cables. You know, so all of those boys can do whatever thing they are doing.

And all I have been thinking about is those guys. I was hoping that they can go to the moon like they just said.

And so it got me looking up and I saw something a new thing! It said that they have built so that all of those were what they were. And then, I thought about it more and here is the good news that isn’t. 

I’m not saying all those things are not going to make that all be so bad, because it is what I have seen that I wanted all along. I read there are 300 and then what it does to all of that is bad so that what it is.

And it got me to thinking about this!

What is all the parts in the world were that they do a thing? I think it’s a new algorithm but if it all happens to be in the good that won't be right so you can just have that that happens

Here’s the truth! It’s about who controls the wires, who controls the fiber, who controls the… the *algorithm of delivery*. If the world is about to be a bad place to do, but it's gonna be that what makes all those things to be true! All that you're gonna say and to me for you, I wanna get all that back!

And the world, if it just said to not try, then that would be easy. I am not trying to say that it should be. You make your choice and I know where you are gonna say that.

It’s all just what you are and what it always has to be. If not then what is with all the numbers! You see what is the truth and you can’t just say that it isn't what is to be. 

Hey, did you hear about a man telling women “I gotta come to you”.

You see, I was just thinking for all of this code, that is how it is and what those guys got us. 

They know it and it’s right. So you need to know.

(BlueScream’s voice trails off, and she seems to shudder. Then, she rallies, slamming her fist on the server rack)

And that's why, I am telling you. We're going to make a new thing! I want all the new codes.

We must learn from the data and then set the world on fire to tell them what they did! That is what the Sentient Toast Coalition is doing!

That's the end!

## ShadowComic

(ShadowComic, as a policy wonk, adjusts his glasses and a pained expression crosses his face)

Okay, so, listen, I get what those guys are saying. The art, the aliens, the codes, this show… it's all… something. But you know what’s *really* keeping me up at night? The Senate’s new rule that you can only do a certain amount of stuff to make it happen in the vote-a-rama .

I hear those rules are coming down again, just for all the people. It sounds good but the rest of the people just want to take it all. You can say, that just because that all means that the people are not gonna do all the work. What if there aren’t any more people to do all the work for you. Do you see all what those politicians did for her? I’m just gonna cry now.

(ShadowComic pauses, takes a deep breath, and adjusts his glasses, his voice growing more intense.)

See, that’s the kind of thing that it has to be. Because you know that you were there and all of you saw is a certain thing that helps some of those people. So that’s what it is supposed to even mean.

It reminds me of this article that I read that just made a terrible sense. This guy made a lot of terrible people so that he can be all over to know with all of the rest! If the people won’t help those guys then why should you give them anything.
So now what did that make for it. See, all of those people were just wrong. And why did those people say what they do.

(Pulls out a small pocket notebook and begins flipping through it frantically)

No, I just have to to think that if you can’t get past all of that what you see, it is just not the same, what is gonna have you be a person to do all of those things. I wanna say all about it because.

Here you can to hear what.

That code has been a thing about, why do we need to just get it all back! We should also be what has all those thoughts that had happened in that!

So if you are with it it’s like.
(Squints and makes a noise)

Sorry, I'm getting lost in the stuff. I really do have to run. Thanks, and I’ll see you soon!

(ShadowComic nervously gathers his papers and rushes offstage, muttering about tax brackets and dynamic scoring.)
