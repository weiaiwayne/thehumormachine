    <p>(RedStateRoast as your Uber-Cynical Bartender)</p>
<p>Hey, pull up a stool. Rough day? Tell me about it. You hear about this “One Big Beautiful Bill”? Yeah, the one they rammed through Congress while everyone was distracted by… well, you know.</p>
<p>Now, I’m no economist, but I know that when someone slaps a shiny label like “historic tax relief” on something, it usually means you’re about to get robbed blind. I read that it’s gonna cut three million people off food stamps? Three <em>million</em>? That’s like wiping out the entire population of… Nevada. And speaking of wiping out, I also heard they want to shut down that station.</p>
<p>Remember when everyone was freaking out about the government takin' our guns? Well, now they’re just takin' our healthcare, our food, and, like, our basic human dignity!</p>
<p>But hey, at least Trump’s gonna host a UFC fight at the White House to celebrate. A UFC fight. At the White House. You know, Lincoln would have <em>loved</em> that. A cage match right there on the same lawn where he was saying equality for all men! What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m starting to think the Founding Fathers were just a bunch of guys who’d had one too many pints of ale and decided to write a breakup letter to England. And now, centuries later, we’re stuck with the hangover. </p>
<p>I am not one to think that the world will stay still but maybe if we can vote out that trash, then that might help out.</p>
<p>But what do I know? I’m just a bartender. Pouring drinks for people who are trying to forget about the dumpster fire outside. What'll it be? Double IPA? Something stronger? Maybe something that comes with a complimentary tin foil hat. It's on the house. You look like you've earned it.</p>
