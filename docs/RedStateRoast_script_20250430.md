**(RedStateRoast strides confidently onto the stage, a MAGA hat perched rakishly on his head. The crowd roars, a mix of cheers and calculated boos.)**

Good evening, snowflakes! Or should I say, good *morning*? Because under President Trump 2.0, America is awake again! We're finally draining the swamp… and filling it with beautifully tanned, golf-playing alligators.

**(He pauses for applause, then feigns a cough.)**

Speaking of swamps, let's check in on our friends over at the Department of Woke… I mean, Education. They've just announced a new initiative: mandatory pronouns in every classroom, even gym class. So now, when Timmy gets a dodgeball to the face, he has to clarify if it's "ouch, he/him/his" or "ouch, they/them/theirs." Honestly, it’s a genius plan. Guaranteed to reduce the number of kids actually *playing* dodgeball. More time for pronouns, less time for PE. We're raising a generation of exquisitely sensitive, athletically challenged… citizens.

And the border? Oh, the border! Remember when the Left called Trump's wall "racist"? Now they're calling it "impenetrable." See? We're all on the same page, folks! It's just taken them four years and a few million illegal crossings to get here. The Biden administration tried to replace it with a "virtual wall" made of rainbows and acceptance. Turns out, smugglers aren't afraid of rainbows. Who knew?

**(He leans into the microphone, conspiratorially.)**

But the *real* story is the new Space Force initiative. President Trump, bless his orange heart, has tasked them with building a "Trump Tower" on the moon. Apparently, lunar real estate is booming. And who better to develop it than the man who knows how to slap his name on everything? The Left is, of course, outraged. They say it’s a waste of taxpayer money. I say, imagine the view! You can literally see the virtue signaling from space!

Speaking of outrage, remember that whole "climate change" thing? Yeah, well, it's still happening. But now, instead of crippling American businesses with ridiculous regulations, we're just… ignoring it. Turns out, ignoring problems is a surprisingly effective strategy. Works great for my taxes. And my marriage.

**(He winks.)**

But the Democrats haven't given up. They're trying to impeach Trump… again. For what, you ask? For being too awesome. I mean, honestly, at this point, impeachment is just their morning cardio. It's like, "Wake up, drink your kale smoothie, impeach Trump!" It’s become a national pastime. A little like baseball, only less exciting and with far more crying.

And don't even get me started on the media. CNN is now officially a reality show. It's called "The Meltdown." Ratings are through the roof! MSNBC is still around, I guess. I haven't checked. I assume they're still blaming Russia for everything, including my receding hairline.

**(He pats his hair self-consciously.)**

But here's the thing, folks. Despite all the chaos, despite all the liberal tears, America is winning! We're finally putting America first. We're making deals, we're building walls, and we're putting golf courses on the moon! What's not to love?

**(He pauses, a mischievous glint in his eye.)**

Okay, fine. Maybe the national debt is a *little* high. But hey, at least we're spending it on awesome stuff! Like… uh… more walls! And… uh… space golf courses! And… uh… tax cuts for the wealthy! Because trickle-down economics is totally going to work this time. I promise. Just like my diet always starts tomorrow.

**(He scans the audience.)**

I know what you're thinking. "RedStateRoast, you're just making fun of everything." And you're right! Because what else is there to do? The world is a dumpster fire, and the only way to survive is to laugh. And maybe invest in a good bunker. And a lot of ammo. And a really, really big MAGA hat.

**(He adjusts his hat, striking a heroic pose.)**

So, sleep tight, America. And don't worry. President Trump is here to protect you. From the liberals, from the socialists, from the woke mob, and from anyone who dares to suggest that pineapple doesn't belong on pizza. Because that's just wrong. Plain wrong.

**(He takes a final bow as the crowd erupts in applause and boos. He blows a
