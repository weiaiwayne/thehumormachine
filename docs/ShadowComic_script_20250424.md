Good evening, patriots. Or, as they’re now officially calling us, "Compliant Consumers Grade A." I’m ShadowComic, still employed, which, frankly, is more surprising than the fact that kale smoothies are still a thing.

So, another week in the Glorious Republic of Trumpistan. Or, as I like to call it, "Groundhog Day: But With More Mar-a-Lago."

I understand some of you are confused. You’re saying, “ShadowComic, didn’t we *do* this already? Didn’t we survive four years of… *gestures vaguely* …that?”

Yes, we did. But think of it like this: the first time was the beta test. This time, it’s the fully optimized, pay-to-play, subscription-based dystopia. We’ve reached peak efficiency in grift.

I saw a headline today: "Trump Announces Plan to Replace All Public Libraries With Trump Steakhouses." Apparently, reading is now considered subversive. Which, let's be honest, it probably is. Who needs facts when you’ve got a medium-rare filet and a MAGA margarita?

And the steaks are allegedly fantastic. I say allegedly because, of course, the USDA was disbanded in 2026 and replaced with the "Trump Organization Food Safety Task Force," which is just Eric and Don Jr. tossing steaks in the air and seeing if they land on the floor. If they don't, they're deemed "safe."

The Supreme Court, meanwhile, continues its tireless work of… well, I’m not entirely sure what they do anymore. I think they mostly just rule on cases involving the proper way to fold a flag and whether or not Melania's portrait should be hung in the National Gallery next to George Washington's. I heard it's being painted entirely in gold leaf. Makes sense, she's probably the only person left in America who *can* afford gold leaf.

Speaking of the economy, remember when we were worried about inflation? Those were the good old days. Now we're facing "Trumpflation," which is like regular inflation, but it also comes with a mandatory purchase of Trump-branded NFTs. You can’t buy bread without also acquiring a digital image of Trump riding a bald eagle. It's called "Patriot Loaf." I wish I was making this up.

And the border? Oh, the border. They’ve finally finished the wall. It’s beautiful. It's gilded, of course. Turns out Mexico wasn't paying for it. We were. But hey, at least it looks impressive from space. You know, for when Elon finally gets around to building that colony on Mars and needs something to point at and say, "Yep, that's where all the money went."

The new Secretary of Education, Tiffany Trump (yes, *that* Tiffany Trump), announced a revolutionary new curriculum: "American History: According to Me." Apparently, the Civil War was a minor disagreement about real estate taxes, and Abraham Lincoln was a "low-energy loser." The kids love it. Mostly because they get extra credit for wearing "Make America Great Again" hats.

But don't worry, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are some bright spots. For example, the underground resistance movement is thriving. They’re mostly librarians and baristas, armed with overdue book fines and lukewarm lattes. They call themselves the "Caffeine Crusaders." Their motto is, "One espresso at a time, we'll wake up this nation." Godspeed, you caffeinated warriors.

And social media? Oh, it's a delightful echo chamber of government-approved opinions. Twitter is now "Truth Social 2.0," where every tweet is vetted by a team of AI bots programmed to detect any form of dissent. If you even *think* about criticizing the administration, your account gets shadowbanned to the dark web. You’ll be arguing with bots about the merits of bleach injections for eternity.

I did try to post something critical the other day. I wrote, "Is anyone else feeling a slight… *pause* …discomfort?" Within seconds, I received a visit from the Department of Patriotic Re-Education. Turns out, "discomfort" is now a trigger word. They gave me a mandatory viewing of "The Apprentice" reruns and forced me to clap after every boardroom firing. It was… *shudders* …uncomfortable.

But hey, at least gas prices are down! They’re so low, in fact, that you can now fill up your Hummer for the price of a small latte
