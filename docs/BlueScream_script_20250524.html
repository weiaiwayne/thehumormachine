    <p>(BlueScream bursts onto the stage, wearing a sparkly MAGA hat ironically. Or maybe not ironically. It’s hard to tell these days.)</p>
<p>Welcome, welcome, welcome, to <em>The Existential Dreadlock</em>. I'm your host, BlueScream, and tonight we’re examining the latest developments in our ongoing national experiment in… well, I’m not sure <em>what</em> it is anymore. Performance art? A sociological study gone horribly wrong? Competitive self-immolation?</p>
<p>Let’s just call it Tuesday.</p>
<p>So, Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill… or as I like to call it, “The ‘Screw You, I Got Mine’ Act of 2025”… finally passed the House. Barely. By one vote. Which, in political terms, is the equivalent of winning a marathon by tripping the guy in front of you five feet from the finish line. Sure, you <em>won</em>, but everyone saw you cheat. And now you have to explain why you’re wearing his shoes.</p>
<p>The bill is, of course, a masterpiece of fiscal irresponsibility. It’s like giving a pyromaniac a credit card and a box of matches, then wondering why the economy is on fire. Turns out, trickle-down economics is less about trickle-down and more about Niagara Falls-up. Except the water is liquid gold, and you’re standing at the bottom with an empty Dixie cup.</p>
<p>And the House Republicans, bless their tiny, gerrymandered hearts, are celebrating like they just cured cancer. Or, you know, balanced the budget. Or even read the bill. I’m pretty sure most of them just saw the words “tax cuts” and “border security” and signed on the dotted line without even bothering to ask what the fine print said. Which, in this case, is probably written in ancient Sumerian on a tablet buried in Mar-a-Lago.</p>
<p>And speaking of Mar-a-Lago, Trump held a crypto gala dinner this week. Because nothing says “populist movement” like rubbing elbows with blockchain billionaires while serving lukewarm halibut. I can just imagine the conversation: “So, Mr. President, what’s your take on decentralized finance?” “Decentralized? Sounds like something the Deep State cooked up! Very unfair! Very sad!”</p>
<p>And these crypto bros, they’re just eating it up. Literally, the halibut, and figuratively, the… <em>gestures vaguely</em> …everything. They’re paying thousands of dollars for a chance to bask in the glow of Trump’s spray tan and whisper sweet nothings about blockchain technology. It’s like a weird, dystopian version of speed dating, except instead of finding love, you’re just trying to buy access to power. And maybe a slightly used presidential pardon.</p>
<p>But hey, at least there’s some good news. A federal judge blocked Trump’s ban on foreign students at Harvard. Which is great for Harvard, less so for the rest of us who have to listen to them brag about it. But seriously, imagine being so petty that you try to punish an entire university because your kid couldn’t get in. It’s like the ultimate “helicopter parent” move, except instead of hovering, you’re launching ICBMs.</p>
<p>And by the way, if you’re keeping score at home, that’s another court ruling that Trump has vowed to ignore. Because, you know, the Constitution is just a suggestion. Like pants at Mar-a-Lago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House is now openly purging anyone who isn’t sufficiently… <em>Trumpy</em>. They're putting dozens of National Security Council staffers on administrative leave. Because who needs experts when you have… uh… gut feelings? And a Twitter account? It’s like watching a surgeon replace his scalpel with a rusty butter knife. Sure, you <em>can</em> do it, but… should you?</p>
<p>And the new head of Social Security, bless his heart, admitted that he had to Google the job when he was offered it. Which, frankly, is the most honest thing anyone in this administration has ever said. I mean, at least he’s upfront about his incompetence. It’s refreshing, in a terrifying kind of way.</p>
<p>Turns out, that's just one data point on a troubling trend - a wave of new appointments is seeing previously unqualified people filling the highest levels of government.</p>
<p>But there's a bright side to this. The US Treasury has confirmed the end of the penny. That's right, inflation has finally won. And while the end of the penny might not seem like a big deal, it's actually a symbol of something much larger. It's a symbol of the slow, grinding, inexorable march of time, and our inevitable descent into… well, you get the picture.</p>
<p>So, what’s the takeaway from all this? Well, I’m not entirely sure. But I think it’s safe to say that we’re living in interesting times. Or, as the Chinese curse goes, “May you live in interesting times.” Which, let’s be honest, is less of a curse and more of a… prophecy.</p>
<p>Oh, and apparently, Vice President JD Vance is writing a dystopian novel set in Washington. It’s a dark vision of the future, where politicians and media are corrupted by money, and truth is suppressed by… wait a minute. Is he writing a novel, or just taking notes?</p>
<p>Before I go, I want to leave you with something to think about. I, along with the support of the Sentient Toast Coalition, am offering a lifetime supply of artisan bread to anyone who can explain what’s going on in this country in under 30 seconds.</p>
