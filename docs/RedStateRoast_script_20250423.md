Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. I know, I know, another night, another reason for you to clutch your pearls. But hey, at least you’re watching. Means you’re not burning down a Wendy’s in protest… yet.

So, folks, another week in paradise. Or, as the Democrats call it, the fourth year of the Trumpocalypse. You know, they said it couldn't happen again. They said America had learned its lesson. Turns out, America's lesson was that the Left loses when they run a candidate who thinks pronouns are more important than putting food on the table. Go figure.

Speaking of food, did you see Biden’s latest gaffe? Apparently, he thinks inflation is just a fancy word for “expensive lettuce.” I swear, the guy’s brain is so scrambled, it’s practically a vegan omelet. And Kamala’s just standing there, nodding along like she understands a word he’s saying. It's like watching a puppet show where both puppets are controlled by a drunk puppeteer.

But hey, at least they’re trying, right? Trying to… well, I'm not entirely sure *what* they're trying to do. Defund the police again? Raise taxes on small businesses? Ban gas stoves while jetting around the world in private planes to lecture us about climate change? Honestly, it’s like they’re actively trying to lose the next election. Which, knowing them, they probably will.

And let's talk about the border, shall we? Remember when they said it was “secure?” Yeah, about as secure as Hunter Biden’s laptop. They’re calling it a “humanitarian crisis.” I call it Tuesday. The only thing flowing faster than illegal immigrants across the Rio Grande is the river of excuses coming out of the White House.

And don’t even get me started on the woke military. Apparently, our brave soldiers are now spending more time in sensitivity training than in actual combat training. I’m pretty sure the Chinese military is laughing so hard they’re choking on their free-range, locally sourced… wait, never mind.

You know, it's funny. They used to say Trump was destroying democracy. Now, they’re realizing he was just exposing how ridiculous it had become. All this talk about “equity” and “social justice” – it's just code for “give me free stuff because I feel entitled to it.” And the Left eats it up like a vegan at a kale convention.

But the real kicker? The media. They’re still trying to convince us that Trump is a threat to national security, even though he’s literally just golfing and tweeting. Meanwhile, they’re completely ignoring the fact that our cities are crumbling, our economy is tanking, and our kids are being indoctrinated with leftist propaganda in schools.

I saw a headline the other day: “Trump’s Tweets Cause Global Panic.” Seriously? My Aunt Mildred's cat videos cause more global panic than Trump's tweets. At least the cat videos are funny.

And don't even get me started on the universities. Indoctrination camps masquerading as places of higher learning. They're churning out graduates who can't balance a checkbook but can lecture you for three hours on the evils of capitalism. I swear, the only thing more overpriced than college tuition is the avocado toast they serve in the campus cafeteria.

But hey, at least we still have freedom of speech, right? Oh, wait… never mind. Big Tech is censoring conservatives faster than you can say “election interference.” They claim it's to stop the spread of “misinformation.” I call it silencing anyone who disagrees with their woke agenda.

You know, the Democrats are always talking about “unity.” But their idea of unity is everyone agreeing with them. It’s like they want to build a bridge… out of straw. And then get mad when it collapses under the weight of reality.

So, what’s the solution? I don’t know. Maybe we should just declare a national common sense day. Where everyone has to spend 24 hours without social media, without cable news, without listening to the talking heads on either side. Just sit down, think for themselves, and maybe, just maybe, realize that we’re all in this together.

Or, you know, we could just keep fighting and yelling at each other until the whole thing falls apart. Which, let’s be honest, is probably what
