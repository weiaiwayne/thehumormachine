Good evening, citizens of dystopia! I'm BlueScream, and welcome to *Apocalypse Now-ish*, the only show brave enough to ask the question: are we living in the end times, or just a particularly embarrassing dress rehearsal?

This week, folks, it’s been a real grab bag of existential dread. Like a clown car full of policy failures, each more absurd than the last.

First up, President Trump, bless his heart, is now "disappointed" in his own tax bill. It’s like watching a toddler build a Lego tower, then throwing a tantrum because it’s not tall enough to reach the moon. Turns out, giving trillions of dollars to the wealthy doesn’t actually trickle down. Who knew? Economists, maybe, but who listens to *them* anymore? We’re living in a post-expert society, folks. Where the only qualification for leadership is a Twitter account and an unwavering belief in your own genius. And a multi-million dollar jet “gifted” from Qatar, but let’s not dwell on the details.

Speaking of details, Wall Street has a new nickname for Trump’s trade policy: TACO. Which, for those of you unfamiliar with high finance, stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out.” It’s catchy, it’s accurate, and it’s apparently driving the President absolutely bananas. He threw a full-blown temper tantrum at a reporter who dared to ask him about it. Honestly, I haven’t seen someone get that upset about a food-related insult since Gordon Ramsay tried to eat a gas station burrito.

But hey, at least the financial sector is having fun. They’re practically printing money betting on Trump’s flip-flops. It’s like the entire global economy is now a high-stakes game of “Will He or Won’t He?”, and the only prize is… well, more money for the people who already have too much of it. Isn’t capitalism beautiful?

And because one international debacle isn’t enough, Trump is now “furious” with Putin for not ending the war in Ukraine. “I gave him two weeks!” he reportedly exclaimed. “Two weeks! What does a guy have to do to get some decent tyranny around here?”

It’s like he thinks diplomacy is a reality TV show, and he’s just waiting for Putin to get voted off the island. “Vladimir, you’re fired! Now, pack your bags and hand over the Crimea to the cameras.”

Meanwhile, back in the States, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is busy revoking visas from Chinese students. Apparently, the key to American greatness is… kicking out all the smart people? It’s a bold strategy, Cotton. Let’s see if it pays off in… uh… a nation of increasingly illiterate QAnon followers.

And, in a move that should surprise absolutely no one, Trump is considering pardoning the men who plotted to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Because, you know, what’s a little attempted political violence between friends? It’s not like they actually *succeeded* in overthrowing the government. They were just… brainstorming. Strategizing. Engaging in some lighthearted… *checks notes* …sedition.

But wait, there's more! Our new Surgeon General, RFK Jr., fresh from saving those Canadian ostriches from certain doom, is now threatening to ban government scientists from publishing in top medical journals. Because who needs peer review when you can have… brain worms? It’s the natural way!

And because the Trump administration is apparently determined to turn the United States into a real-life episode of *Black Mirror*, they’re also considering a plan to deport asylum seekers to South Sudan. Yes, South Sudan. A country so stable and prosperous, it’s basically the… *checks notes again* …a failed state ravaged by civil war. I'm sure they'll feel right at home.

It’s all so… inspiring. It's like watching a train derail in slow motion, except the train is our democracy and the conductor is… well, you know.

So, what’s the takeaway from all this? Well, I’m not entirely sure. But I think it’s safe to say that we’re living in interesting times. Or, as the Chinese curse goes, “May you live in interesting times… while simultaneously battling a global pandemic, an economic collapse, and a rapidly escalating descent into authoritarianism.”

And now, a word from our sponsor: “Trump University: Where your dreams of financial ruin… come true! Just like our country!”

Good night, and remember: don’t panic. Unless you’re a foreign student, a scientist, a migrant, a governor, or a moderately-priced taco. Then, maybe panic a little. Just… not too loudly.

*(BlueScream bows, a fortune cookie falls out of her costume, and the audience squints to read the tiny print: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter... the 2028 election cycle.")*
