**(Opening sequence: A montage of increasingly absurd news clips featuring President Trump, interspersed with images of bewildered and exasperated citizens. Upbeat, slightly manic music plays. The BlueScream logo flashes – a stylized blue screen of death with a comedic twist.)**

**(The music abruptly cuts. BlueScream strides confidently onto the stage, a manic grin plastered on his face. He’s dressed in a sharp, slightly rumpled suit, his tie askew.)**

**BlueScream:** Welcome back to BlueScream, the only show brave enough to call "brave" things "true," even when it involves a reality so warped, it makes Salvador Dali look like Bob Ross. Folks, it’s 2025. And if you’re thinking, "Hey, wasn’t this year supposed to have flying cars and robot butlers?", let me assure you, we *do*. They’re just exclusively for the Mar-a-Lago golf course and the robot butlers only serve Diet Coke, exclusively.

**(He pauses for a beat, lets the absurdity sink in.)**

Right, so, the President is back. And by "back" I mean he seems to have unlocked some kind of cheat code in the simulation. He’s not just *leading* the country, he’s *running* it like a particularly chaotic episode of Grand Theft Auto. Except instead of stealing cars, he’s stealing… well, let’s just say “ideas” from North Korea and “fiscal responsibility” from… I actually can't think of anyone.

**(He shrugs, feigning innocence.)**

And speaking of stolen ideas, remember infrastructure week? It's still happening! Every week! We're just building it in Minecraft now. It’s far more cost-effective. Plus, no unions!

**(He winks.)**

The latest initiative from the White House is truly inspired. They're replacing all public school textbooks with AI-generated summaries. Apparently, reading is for losers, and who needs historical accuracy when you have algorithms that can rewrite the past to be… well, more *convenient*? I heard the new version of the American Revolution ends with King George offering Trump a really good deal on a golf course.

**(He shakes his head in mock disbelief.)**

But it's not all doom and gloom. The economy is booming! Well, the economy of companies that manufacture MAGA hats and gold-plated Trump statues, anyway. The rest of us are apparently supposed to subsist on… *patriotism*. Which, I’m told, tastes a lot like sawdust and disappointment.

**(He takes a dramatic sip from an imaginary glass.)**

And the culture wars? Oh, they’re raging. The latest battleground is… pronouns. Again. Apparently, the existential threat facing America isn't climate change or income inequality, but whether or not someone prefers to be called "Ze" or "Your Highness." I swear, the only thing more terrifying than the current state of affairs is the fact that we're arguing about something so… *minor*. It's like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic while the iceberg is hosting a tiki party.

**(He gestures wildly.)**

And the Supreme Court? Don’t even get me started. They’re so conservative now, they're literally starting to dig up the Founding Fathers to ask them if they *really* meant for women to have rights. I’m pretty sure if we asked them about the internet, they’d try to burn it for witchcraft.

**(He leans into the microphone, conspiratorially.)**

But here’s the kicker. Despite all this, despite the chaos, the absurdity, the sheer, unadulterated *Trumpness* of it all… people are getting used to it. We’re becoming desensitized. We’re adapting. Which is, frankly, the scariest thing of all.

**(He pauses, his smile fading slightly.)**

We're like frogs in a slowly boiling pot of conspiracy theories and Fox News soundbites. We’re so busy arguing about the temperature, we don’t realize we're about to be served with a side of freedom fries.

**(He snaps back to his manic persona.)**

But hey, at least the fries are still free, right? Right?

**(He stares intensely at the camera for a beat.)**

Speaking of free, remember free speech? That's still around, technically. As long as what you're saying is sufficiently sycophantic. Otherwise, you might find yourself on a new government watchlist, "The List of People Who Don’t Appreciate America Enough." Apparently, appreciating America involves a mandatory pledge of allegiance to the President’s hair.

**(He runs a hand through his own hair, looking slightly panicked.)**

I'm just kidding! They haven
