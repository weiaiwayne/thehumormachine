    <p><em>(BlueScream shuffles onstage in a bathrobe and fuzzy slippers, clutching a mug that reads, "My Other Mug is a Federal Indictment.")</em></p>
<p><strong>BlueScream:</strong> Good evening, fellow insomniacs. Or, as I like to call you, "the only people still fact-checking at 3 AM." I'm BlueScream, and tonight, we're diving headfirst into the political dumpster fire, because apparently, sleep is a privilege reserved for the wealthy and well-adjusted.</p>
<p>So, the House Republicans are <em>still</em> trying to ram through Trump’s "Big, Beautiful Bill," which, if you haven’t been following, is basically a reverse Robin Hood situation: steal from the poor, give to the… slightly less poor, and then tell everyone it’s “economic stimulus.” It's trickle-down economics, except instead of water, it’s just…debt.</p>
<p>I heard they were struggling to get the votes, which is surprising, because I thought “economic ruin for the working class” was, like, the GOP’s official platform. Apparently, even <em>they</em> have a limit to how much… “winning” America can take. It’s like finding out that even sharks have a gag reflex.</p>
<p>And now Trump had to sweeten the deal, inviting the reluctant Republicans for a “last minute” chat at the White House. Oh, to be a fly on the wall during <em>that</em> meeting. Picture this: Trump, surrounded by nervous Congresspeople, explaining the intricacies of tax policy using only hand gestures and vague promises of… “something amazing.” I’m guessing “amazing” involves more gold plating and fewer consequences.</p>
<p>Of course, the IMF is “urging the US to curb its deficit” like it’s some kind of a casual suggestion. “Hey, maybe <em>don’t</em> drive the global economy off a cliff? Just a thought!” Meanwhile Trump is thinking of opening up US retirement plans to private equity, because nothing says “secure future” like letting hedge fund managers play roulette with your nest egg. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is <em>still</em> blocking deportations under wartime law, which is…reassuring, I guess? Like, “Yes, we’re a country governed by laws! Mostly!” It’s like finding out that the Titanic had <em>some</em> lifeboats. Sure, they only saved a fraction of the passengers, but hey, at least they weren’t <em>all</em> left to freeze to death. Silver linings, folks. Silver linings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, bless his perpetually-confused heart, testified on Capitol Hill about the administration’s foreign policy changes. I imagine it was a masterclass in dodging questions and using the word "strategic" as many times as humanly possible. At this point, "strategic" has lost all meaning. It's like "thoughts and prayers" for international relations.</p>
<p>“We’re strategically cutting aid to… uh… places,” he probably said, “because… strategy! And… freedom! And… Taylor Swift!” Because let's be honest, Taylor Swift is more qualified to handle foreign policy than half the people in this administration.</p>
<p>Speaking of people who are… <em>questionably</em>… qualified, VP JD Vance attended Pope Leo XIV’s inaugural mass. Which, I'm sure, was a fascinating clash of ideologies. You’ve got the Vatican, ancient seat of spiritual authority, and then you’ve got… JD Vance. It’s like pairing a fine wine with a gas station hot dog. The mind reels. But hey, maybe it’s a sign of things to come. Maybe the new Pope will endorse Trump, and we’ll all be living in a theocratic dystopia where the only acceptable form of worship is… well, whatever Trump says it is.</p>
<p>And the hits just keep on coming. The DOJ is now "eyeing" Cuomo’s testimony, because apparently, we've got to prosecute Democrats for things they did <em>before</em> Trump started, ya know, the full fascist state. As for how they are being sentenced? No one knows... but it is all about shaming them... not laws!</p>
<p>Finally, let's not forget the big picture, which is that everything is awful. We're spiraling toward economic ruin, our international relationships are in shambles, and our government is increasingly resembling a poorly written dystopian novel. But hey, at least we have each other. And my mug.</p>
<p>(Raises mug in a mock toast)</p>
<p>So, stay vigilant, stay caffeinated, and remember: the only way to survive this madness is to laugh. Or, you know, move to Canada. But they're probably putting up a wall right now.</p>
<p>Good night, and try to resist the urge to doomscroll until sunrise. I’ll see you on the other side of the apocalypse.
