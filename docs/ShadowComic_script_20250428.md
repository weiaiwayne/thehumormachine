**(Opening shot: ShadowComic strides confidently onto a dimly lit stage, a single spotlight illuminating him. He adjusts his tie, a sardonic smile playing on his lips.)**

ShadowComic: Well, folks, here we are again. Another week, another existential crisis brought to you by the same people who brought you dial-up internet. How’s everyone enjoying the second Trump term? I know I am. It’s like reliving the past, only this time with more surveillance and fewer functioning democracies.

(He pauses for a beat, letting the irony sink in.)

Remember when we all thought 2020 was the worst year ever? Oh, sweet, naive us. We were still clinging to the illusion that rock bottom had a floor. Turns out, it was a trapdoor to the sub-basement, where they keep the unsold MAGA hats and the original draft of *The Art of the Deal*.

So, what’s been keeping the administration busy this week? Oh, you know, the usual. Declaring war on pronouns, investigating Hunter Biden’s laptop for evidence of… I don’t know, alien collusion? And, of course, the ongoing quest to prove that the 2020 election was stolen by… well, let’s just say the usual suspects. I hear they’ve found compelling evidence in the form of a blurry photo of a pigeon wearing a Biden t-shirt. Case closed, I guess.

(He raises an eyebrow, feigning surprise.)

Speaking of elections, the midterms are coming up. And you know what that means: another round of voter suppression tactics disguised as election integrity measures. It's like they're playing a game of political whack-a-mole, only the mole is anyone who isn't a white, rural octogenarian with a penchant for conspiracy theories.

But hey, at least gas prices are down! Thanks, President Trump, for single-handedly manipulating global oil markets through sheer force of will and a series of strongly worded tweets. I’m sure that’s exactly how it happened. It couldn’t possibly be anything to do with the global recession we’re teetering on the edge of, could it? Nah.

And don't even get me started on the Supreme Court. It's like a judicial branch of the Republican Party now. I half expect them to start wearing red hats and chanting "Lock her up!" during oral arguments. They’re so busy overturning decades of precedent, I’m surprised they haven’t declared the Earth flat yet. Give them time.

(He takes a sip of water, looking directly into the camera.)

But it's not all doom and gloom, folks. There's still hope. I mean, we have memes. And dark humor. And the unwavering belief that maybe, just maybe, this is all one elaborate, very long, very unfunny joke.

And speaking of jokes, have you seen the new Secretary of Education? Apparently, her qualifications include a deep understanding of homeschooling (specifically, how to avoid teaching critical race theory) and a complete lack of experience in… well, anything remotely related to education. She seems perfectly qualified.

(He chuckles dryly.)

And let's not forget about the economy. It's booming! Well, according to the President, anyway. In reality, it's more like a carefully constructed house of cards balanced on the shoulders of gig workers and Amazon warehouse employees. But hey, at least the stock market is doing great. For the top 1%, that is. The rest of us are just trying to figure out how to afford groceries and healthcare. You know, the basics.

But don’t worry, the administration has a plan to fix it all. It involves tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation of everything, and a whole lot of blaming immigrants. It’s a classic. Works every time.

(He sighs dramatically.)

You know, sometimes I wonder if I’m just yelling into the void. If anyone is actually listening. If any of this even matters. But then I remember that I have a platform, and a voice, and a burning desire to make fun of the people in power. So, I keep going.

Because if we don’t laugh, we’ll cry. And frankly, I’m all cried out.

Besides, what else am I going to do? Get a real job? In this economy? Please.

(He leans into the microphone, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.)

They’re watching me, you know. The administration. They don’t like what I do. They don’t like that I make people think. They’d rather I just shut up and toe the line. But I won’t.

Because freedom of speech is a fundamental right. Unless you’re critical of the President, of course. Then it’
