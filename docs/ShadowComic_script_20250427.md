Alright, alright, settle down, patriots and… you know… the others. Welcome back to “Truth Hurts,” the only show brave enough to tell you what’s *really* going on, because frankly, nobody else can afford the legal bills.

So, here we are. 2025. The year we were promised flying cars, instead we got… well, let's just say the only thing flying high is the national debt. And Trump's approval ratings. (He pauses for a beat, letting the groan ripple through the audience.)

Yeah, I know, I know. We all thought lightning couldn't strike twice. Turns out, it can, especially when the lightning rod is made of solid gold and tweets at 3 AM. Remember those simpler times when the biggest worry was whether he'd call Kim Jong-un "Rocket Man" again? Now, we're nostalgic for nuclear brinkmanship. Progress!

This week, the President announced his new initiative to "Make America Great... Again, Again." The cornerstone of this plan? A nationwide competition to build the most beautiful border wall. Forget infrastructure, folks, we're talking art! Think "Extreme Home Makeover: Fortress Edition." The winning state gets a golden plaque... mounted directly onto the wall. Because subtlety is for losers.

And speaking of losers, the Supreme Court just overturned the First Amendment. Kidding!… mostly. They *did* rule that corporations have the right to sue anyone who criticizes their products online. Free speech, meet "Profit Protection Act 2.0." So, if you happen to dislike the taste of, say, genetically modified locust burgers, maybe keep it to yourself. Or better yet, tweet it from a VPN in Kazakhstan. I hear they have great internet… and no extradition treaty.

But it's not all doom and gloom. There's good news too! The Department of Education has announced a new curriculum focused on "Alternative Facts and American Exceptionalism." History will now be taught through interpretive dance. I’m not kidding, they are using TikTok to teach the Civil War. Apparently, Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation just didn't have enough viral potential.

The best part? They're replacing standardized testing with a nationwide beauty pageant. Because who needs critical thinking when you have cheekbones? The winner gets a full scholarship to Trump University... which, by the way, is now fully accredited. Turns out, all you need is a billion-dollar donation and a signed photo of the President. Who knew?

Meanwhile, Vice President Ivanka is spearheading a campaign to eradicate "fake news" by replacing all journalists with AI-generated avatars. They're programmed to only report positive stories about the administration and wear matching power suits. The future of journalism is here, folks, and it's terrifyingly stylish.

And let's not forget about the economy. Inflation is through the roof, unemployment is higher than Trump's golf handicap, and the only industry booming is the production of MAGA-branded survival bunkers. But hey, at least we’re energy independent! We're now exporting refined patriotism to countries who can't get enough of our… unique brand of leadership.

The new Space Force, by the way, has discovered intelligent life on Mars. They’ve named them the "Really Great Martians" and invited them to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend of golf and classified briefings. Apparently, the Martians are big fans of the wall idea. They're thinking of building one around their own planet to keep out the… well, you know.

But the biggest story of the week? Trump announced his plans to run for president *again* in 2028. He says he's "just getting started." Which, frankly, is the most terrifying thing anyone has said since… well, since he announced he was running in 2016.

So, what does this all mean? Well, it means we're living in a reality show written by a committee of caffeinated squirrels with access to nuclear codes. It means the apocalypse is probably just around the corner, but at least we'll have a really beautiful wall to hide behind. And it means I need a drink.

**(ShadowComic pauses, takes a long, deliberate sip from a hidden flask. The glitching White House on the screen behind him flickers momentarily, then settles into a slightly more distorted version of itself.)**

Don’t forget to tune in next week, when we’ll be discussing the new national anthem, which is now a remix of “YMCA” and the sound of a bald eagle screeching. Good night, and may the odds be ever… oh, who am I
