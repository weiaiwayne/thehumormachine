    <p><strong>(RedStateRoast swaggers onto the stage, wearing a Hawaiian shirt tucked into khakis. He holds a pineapple with an American flag toothpick sticking out of it.)</strong></p>
<p>Aloha, patriots! Or as the Left would say, “Greetings, potential climate change deniers!” I’m RedStateRoast, back to decode the latest dumpster fire that is American politics.</p>
<p>First off, folks, let’s talk about Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.” I mean, what <em>isn’t</em> big and beautiful these days? My blood pressure, for one. My student loan debt… oh wait, I paid that off by selling commemorative Trump NFTs, didn’t I?</p>
<p>This bill is so big, it makes Obamacare look like a pamphlet. It’s so beautiful, it makes AOC’s Green New Deal look like… well, a compost heap.</p>
<p>And what’s <em>in</em> this bill, you ask? Besides enough red tape to strangle a woke mermaid? Well, it seems our fearless leader is slashing Medicaid, because apparently, healthcare is a privilege, not a right. Unless you’re a Qatari prince offering a sweet deal on a gold-plated 757. Then healthcare is… negotiable.</p>
<p>The Left is screaming, of course. “People will die!” they cry. As if <em>that’s</em> a new concept. Folks, life is terminal. Get over it. Besides, fewer Medicaid recipients means a smaller government, and a smaller government means… well, I'm not sure, but it sounds like freedom to me! It's like Darwinism, but with paperwork!</p>
<p>And to add insult to injury, there is that tiny little note buried on page 756, paragraph 3, section 2, subsection B, entry 4 of the bill, stating that all Federal Courts will now be unable to enforce any contempt citation.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right folks- Trump is straight up trying to make himself king! This is some serious tin-pot dictator shit. I'm starting to think he is reading the playbook for aspiring despots, chapter by chapter.</p>
<p>But hey, at least we won’t have to listen to those pesky judges telling him what to do, or not do. I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of unelected officials thwarting the will of the… oh, right. We still have elections. For now.</p>
<p>And speaking of elections… Trump's hosting another memecoin dinner. Remember that? The one where people are paying a million bucks a plate to chow down with the Donald.</p>
<p>If you think he's a populist, just remember that the price of admission to his inner circle is now roughly equivalent to the GDP of a small island nation.</p>
<p>That leads me to my next topic- a few brave souls have decided to protest all the tomfoolery. But I have to ask, what is the point? Those people protesting the "million dollar memecoin dinner" are out of their minds, the millions are lining the pockets of Trump! If I was one of those protestors, I'd want a cut!</p>
<p>And the news just broke... the protesters were from a local chapter of "Canine Liberation Front". Apparently, they wanted to send a message about the horrible conditions Trump's hair stylist has to endure.
"She's trapped in a gilded cage!" shouted a protester clad in a dog costume. "We must free the stylist!"</p>
<p>Look, I support animals. I really do. But isn’t that a bit dramatic?
It's not like those protesters were going to change anyone's mind. A MAGA head's mind is harder than a petrified pinecone.</p>
<p>But don't think for a minute that the Democrats are any better. Did you see that some of them are all in a tizzy because Trump is planning a military parade for his birthday?</p>
<p>“How dare he!” they shriek. “It’s so authoritarian!” Oh, please. Like they wouldn’t do the same if they had the chance. Plus, who doesn’t love a good parade? Tanks, jets, those guys in the goofy hats who ride the tiny bicycles… It’s good, clean, American fun! And hey, maybe we can use the parade to “accidentally” annex Canada.</p>
<p>But what is the latest on the world stage? Well, as it turns out, the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a meeting with Trump, and Trump took the opportunity to… share some questionable information about white genocide in South Africa.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that’s not a problem. But maybe, just maybe, the Oval Office isn’t the best place to air that particular grievance. It’s like bringing up your weird foot fungus at a wedding. There’s a time and a place, people!</p>
<p>And what was the South African president’s response? Something about not having a plane to give Trump. Oh, <em>snap</em>. That’s the international equivalent of “bless your heart.” I bet Trump didn’t see that coming. I know what I want on a T-Shirt now "Sorry I don't have a plane to give you"</p>
<p>And this is where it all gets confusing... Trump took that joke to heart and now, is now granting aslyum to white South Africans? Can someone <em>please</em> tell me, what the heck is going on?</p>
<p>But hey, it’s not all bad news, folks. The Treasury Department is finally considering killing the penny! I say, good riddance. Who needs those little copper nuisances? They clog up our wallets, they weigh down our pockets, and they’re practically worthless. I mean, come on, people! Now, if you</p>
