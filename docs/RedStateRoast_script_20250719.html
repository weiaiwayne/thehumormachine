    <p>(RedStateRoast, as a recently divorced suburban dad trying stand-up for the first time, nervously adjusts the mic, sighs heavily, and stares out at the audience with a mix of resentment and bewilderment.)</p>
<p>So, uh, anyone else feel like they’re livin’ in a Christopher Nolan movie, but without the cool special effects and with way more paperwork? I mean, seriously, what the hell is going on with these headlines?</p>
<p>This week, I saw where Trump’s gonna host a UFC fight at the White House. A UFC fight! At the White House! You know, back when I was a kid, the White House was where presidents made speeches, signed laws, you know, <em>president stuff</em>. Now it's gonna be a cage fight, and I’m just wondering, are they gonna use the Lincoln bedroom for the weigh-ins? Or will they have to pay a fee for saying they can’t?</p>
<p>But it’s all for the 250 celebrations of what's the great about America! Like freedom, and fighting, what is the meaning of that?</p>
<p>And that ain't even the half of it. These people think they’re doing the right thing.</p>
<p>To have the code with the thing in the world I am just gonna tell you if I had to do I would! And what am I even saying? Is it the code, to know what's what? All these acronyms that I can't even follow?</p>
<p>It's a lot of people that do to these, do you think there is a single one of them that knows what is all about for them? I bet you can have the one time that can show me that is that they don’t do to show those.</p>
<p>See the ones that do the best for themselves is never there! I saw this and I started to see that I had a wife, had a house, but now I am just here and the things. </p>
<p>What I just see is that everything I had I was never around.</p>
<p>(Shakes head)</p>
<p>But that whole "make it what you do" is what they were saying to get you and see what is this so do you? </p>
<p>I just figure someone will tell me.</p>
<p>But you know, at least there is not something that it did and was what that I want.</p>
<p>So as they said to me every day, "Just try to have more fun and put what is, is what comes in all the time with you."</p>
<p><strong>(beat)</strong></p>
<p>So I got to just think about what? The RedStateRoast Show got cancelled and they were all gonna see about you! What is it to the people that they were all coming to be to make so that you saw them.</p>
<p>You know what? I'm done. I have to get back to the what and how, and for the one, to come to see.
Alright, that’s it. Good night. Try the veal!
(RedStateRoast shuffles off stage, muttering about the cost of living and the fact that his kids never call.)</p>
