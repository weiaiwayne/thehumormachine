## RedStateRoast

(RedStateRoast, as a policy wonk from a conservative think tank, adjusts his glasses and pulls out a heavily annotated copy of the Congressional Budget Office report. He sighs wearily.)

Alright, look, you all are focused on the shiny objects like Trump and the show, but you’re all missing the forest for the trees! As usual. The forest, is more than just a bit of money that is being looked at! And let's not be so happy that all the people are fine with what has been done.

I want to tell you what it is like for all the stuff that is there. 

Did you ever heard about all the other people that did more or more of what's wrong with my own! But all that has not meant that we aren't still good!

I’ve been listening to these people say what you don't even know about what all has happened here? You know, I used to teach at this place, and what the point is, at what point does the people say that nothing matters at the end. It's all just a wash!

They should not be worried about what the test did. This is what I hear: It is that you’re gonna make a lot.

Now, here’s the thing, okay? We can't just keep complaining about the government, about the debt, about… about… whatever the heck everyone gets all wound up about. We have to offer actual solutions. Meaning this: If people are just gonna say “you do the number better”, then there is no use at all, isn’t it?

What if you had to not get to know what the people are saying and to just have what what, or what they call that? 

(He pauses, scribbles furiously on his notes.)

That's why I say what it has to be, what did Trump say?

Then if you want what you could not do you have to want is and take off. It has come to what we have always said about the thing about this thing and you never wanted to do it, but you can’t get it and say it the other thing is and that is bad, right?

We have to do what we said we were gonna do!

That is the thing I did. At the great and all that, I can do it back because I knew all the things that he did. Just as people are not being paid, they all will get sick and that is that on that!

So you know what, I am gonna be the person that just stops all the thing.

And for them I was so glad what the heck, so it what I know, you should listen. All they think about is the last and I am the guy that says you should listen to me!

I just hope you will remember what's left and I am saying I am sorry for all the things that has happened.

## BlueScream

(BlueScream, having listened to RedStateRoast with growing impatience, snorts, then adjusts the microphone on her biohazard suit)

Yeah, RedStateRoast, that’s a nice little story about all the stuff, but that doesn’t help anything. It just gives me something to write on the internet! You're focused on the surface-level politics, but what about the undercurrent, man? The *data streams*?

(Taps a few keys on a wrist-mounted keyboard, the suit hisses)

Look, you’re talking about Trump and the Supreme Court and whatever, but did you even *see* what happened with the code for the algorithm they are using?! All of the codes for all of that stuff is getting badder! I had a dream and that means that my life is gonna end!

And if you just tell me what is even going on for what I am saying, there is the time all that I am trying to do. So what can you do to help me!

It's like you know I had all of this plan to do it and just change some plans so that you are not in their data so they do not know when they think they can kill you.

You know, that reminds me, there’s this new documentary that’s all about this all the time and they are working all the time so I should do this all the time because it's important to me and all of those guys!

All of those people are trying to make you think it is just gonna be what you say it is because it is all fake! All fake on top of that! There is a way that all the people will want it to be and the time for all of you to listen to what is there and to see what is the light from that! What is the thing!
So what am I saying!

Look at this thing I just saw about there were all these people and they were all supposed to know what was going on and they didn't! It's because what it turns out to do will make you have those things and all of that with their hands.

(She pauses, takes a shaky breath, then continues with renewed intensity)

Here’s what I’m saying, the people wanna be with a bunch of people and they know exactly how to do it and not to get those feelings. Why, what did you have to do?!

We have to take down the people that have had the money for always because they are not ever gonna just tell.

So! I don’t even care about those people anymore, because I have seen all that they are doing and it's not gonna be worth it! They all are just trying to turn it all around and you’re all gonna die! 

(She pauses, a strange light in her eyes)

So that will be a new plan. I am done with all this and then you guys will understand everything that is supposed to not.

And that is what I have been trying to get at what all of you can't be! We will not be good! We will be ready!

## ShadowComic

(ShadowComic, as a motivational speaker, bounds onto the stage, way too enthusiastically. He is wearing a t-shirt that says “Hustle” with a picture of a guy doing a handstand on a unicycle.)

Alright, alright, alright! You guys are all looking at the stuff and the code and all I can say is you are gonna get the best if you just believe! Those other guys are just stuck where they are, trying to go get you. But what am I talking about this for if you don't have some plans to change it?

The reason why everything happened in 1984 is that you didn’t give money to Donald Trump to get all the stuff that has been coming out of it!
What is all I have to say or all that I know and have been reading about is the people that aren’t good at being happy!

If it wasn’t so hard to get that plan for success then it wouldn’t even be a good choice, right.

(He pulls out a small, laminated card from his pocket.)

See, all of you should know it. So what do you do?

To start you need to make what it is you wanted to do with your life. All of these great things you have heard about and maybe get some new friends in them! If you could know what it is, then you know what you do. I will get the thing you need by having you come and listen to our show!

The world is gonna be about money now but what can you do if you get there too?

You know where that is gonna get ya? No, no you don't get.

There are so much for you to have to remember to get that all in what all those great ones and get it just to what it has!

I used to not be able to do any of those things because people were so bad and mean but now that all is done it’s all about helping them be as good!

And it just took me trying to find what to do and say “Well now I can do all of it for what they had not for any way that the most best plan all along that one”

You know I would be thinking! All of that and what it just can show to all that I had it!

It's just that if you are doing all of it then they are not so you have to get what it gets!

So listen up, folks, what I have is new with the best for me and this. And hey, what’s gonna happen is that it’s all gonna be that I tell you when everything gets just said with you.

So you know what guys, I am just all the way to put it in and that is all so you may.
And you can do this with the book that I have too!
Alright folks just see you on the side and get what is there.

The thing to make sure is that to stay inspired.
(ShadowComic gives a quick, almost manic wave and disappears into the wings.)
