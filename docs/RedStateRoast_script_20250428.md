Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. I know, I know, another Trump administration. You’d think after four years of free gas and a booming economy, you’d be used to it by now. But here we are. Still triggered.

Speaking of triggers, did you see that protest outside the Supreme Court last week? Apparently, Justice Kavanaugh enjoys craft beer *and* freedom. Double whammy for the left. They were chanting something about bodily autonomy. You know, the same people who think a fetus is just a “clump of cells” until it needs government-funded daycare. Priorities, people.

And speaking of government funding, Bidenomics is back! Wait, no, sorry. Old habits. Trump is calling it “America First 2.0: Electric Boogaloo.” Catchy, right? The plan is simple: Make America great again… again. Apparently, the first time wasn’t MAGA enough. I’m told this time, we’re adding extra MAGA. Like, plutonium-level MAGA. Hold onto your hats.

I saw a headline the other day that said, "Inflation Hits New Record Low." I almost choked on my freedom fries. Turns out, "new record low" means it's still higher than when Trump was last in office. But hey, at least it's lower than… last month? That’s the new bar, folks. Lower than last month. We’re celebrating incremental failures now. It’s like giving yourself a participation trophy for showing up to your own intervention.

And the border? Secure! Just kidding. It’s about as secure as Hillary Clinton’s email server. But Trump's got a new plan. He's sending Kamala Harris down there to be the "Border Czar" again. Apparently, the first time didn't quite stick. It's like when you tell your toddler to clean their room and they just shove everything under the bed. Solution? Send them back with a bigger shovel.

Meanwhile, our esteemed Vice President, Don Jr., is leading a delegation to negotiate a trade deal with… North Korea. I’m not even making this up. Apparently, Kim Jong-un is a big fan of the “Liberals Get Triggered” podcast. Who knew? I guess even dictators need their daily dose of schadenfreude. I’m just picturing the negotiations now: "We'll give you nukes if you stop saying 'covfefe.'"

The woke corporations are still at it, of course. Bud Light is now selling a new beer called "MAGA Brew." It’s just regular beer, but the can is emblazoned with a picture of Trump in a cowboy hat. They claim it's a marketing strategy. I think they’re just trying to avoid another boycott. You know, because nothing says "we support diversity and inclusion" like pandering to the people who burned your beer in their backyard.

And the media? Still obsessed with Trump. They’re running stories about how he prefers his steak well-done with ketchup. Breaking news, people! The President of the United States likes his steak like a toddler. This is the existential threat facing our nation.

But the best part? The Democrats are still trying to figure out what went wrong. They’re blaming everything but their own radical policies. It’s Russia! It’s misinformation! It’s… Joe Rogan! Anything but admitting that maybe, just maybe, people are tired of being lectured about their privilege while they're struggling to pay their gas bill.

I saw a Democrat strategist on CNN the other day arguing that the party needs to “reconnect with the working class.” Translation: “We need to find a way to pretend we care about the people we’ve been ignoring for the past decade.” Good luck with that. You can’t just slap a union label on a soy latte and expect people to believe you’re one of them.

And the universities? Still churning out woke warriors faster than you can say "microaggression." I heard Yale is now offering a course on “The Politics of Taylor Swift.” Apparently, dissecting her lyrics is more important than learning about, you know, history or economics. I guess it's easier to cancel someone for misgendering a fictional character than it is to balance a budget.

But hey, at least we're not at war. Yet. Trump’s too busy tweeting to start World War III. Although, I did see him retweet a conspiracy theory about how Hillary Clinton is secretly a lizard person. So, you know, anything’s possible.

I tell you what, folks, this is the greatest country in the world. We're free to disagree, free to protest, and free to make fun of each other.
