**(Opening sequence: frantic news clips interspersed with distorted images of Trump's face, ending on a freeze-frame of BlueScream’s exasperated expression. Upbeat, slightly manic theme music fades.)**

**(BlueScream sits behind a slightly-too-clean desk, illuminated by harsh studio lights. He’s wearing a slightly-too-tight suit.)**

**BlueScream:** Welcome back to “Nightly Nitpicking,” where we dissect the dumpster fire that is American democracy with the surgical precision of a toddler wielding a butter knife.

**(He takes a long sip from a suspiciously large coffee mug.)**

So, another week, another existential crisis averted. Or, at least, postponed. It’s hard to tell these days. It's like living in a perpetual "Blue Light Special" of impending doom. You know, the kind where you think you’re getting a deal, but it turns out the apocalypse is just 10% off.

Speaking of discounts, the Trump administration is back, baby! *Four more years!* Or, you know, however long it takes for his advisors to convince him that the moon landing was actually filmed in a soundstage in Mar-a-Lago.

**(He pauses for a beat, staring directly into the camera.)**

I’m not saying it was, but I’m also not *not* saying it. Let’s just say Buzz Aldrin’s golf swing looked suspiciously practiced for zero gravity.

But seriously, folks, it’s like Groundhog Day, except instead of Bill Murray, we’re trapped with a sentient spray tan who believes windmills cause cancer and that climate change is a Chinese hoax. I mean, at least Bill Murray learned something about himself.

**(He gestures vaguely with his hands.)**

And the cabinet appointments? Oh, they’re *chef’s kiss* magnificent. We’ve got the Secretary of Education, who thinks cursive is a communist plot, the Secretary of Energy, who believes in the healing power of crystals, and the Secretary of the Interior, who, I kid you not, tried to rename the Grand Canyon “Trump’s Awesome Hole.”

**(He shakes his head slowly.)**

I’m not making this up. Well, I might be embellishing a *little*. But only to make it more believable. Because, honestly, reality has become so absurd, satire is basically just stenography at this point.

And the Supreme Court? Let’s just say Roe v. Wade is now Roe v. Wasted Opportunity. And affirmative action has been replaced with affirmative inaction. Because, you know, fairness is overrated. Especially when it benefits people who aren’t already obscenely wealthy and powerful.

**(He leans forward conspiratorially.)**

But hey, at least the economy is… stable? Ish? I mean, inflation is still hovering around the “are you kidding me?” level, and wages haven’t kept pace since, oh, I don’t know, the invention of the wheel. But hey, the stock market is doing great! For the 0.1%. Who are, coincidentally, the only people who can afford to eat anything besides ramen and despair.

And don’t even get me started on foreign policy. We’re now best friends with Russia, North Korea, and whatever country has the highest bidder for our nuclear secrets. Our allies? They’re all giving us the side-eye, muttering about “unreliable partners” and “geopolitical instability.” Which, translated from diplomatese, basically means, “We’re pretty sure you’ve all lost your minds.”

**(He sighs dramatically.)**

But it’s not all doom and gloom, folks. I mean, there’s always… uh… well, there’s… hmm. Okay, maybe it *is* all doom and gloom. But hey, at least we have memes! And TikTok dances! And the comforting knowledge that future generations will look back at this era and say, “Wow, they were really, really stupid.”

**(He grabs a remote control and clicks it, bringing up a graphic of a cat wearing a tiny MAGA hat.)**

Speaking of stupid, let’s talk about the latest conspiracy theory sweeping the nation: that the government is controlling our minds through 5G cell towers. Apparently, the same technology that allows you to watch cat videos on your phone is also turning you into a mindless drone.

**(He raises an eyebrow.)**

I mean, I’m not saying it’s not true. But if they *are* controlling our minds, they’re doing a pretty terrible job. Because most people I know are still convinced that pineapple belongs on pizza.

**(He clicks the remote again, bringing up a picture of pineapple on pizza. The audience groans.)**

See? Mind control.

**(He takes another large gulp of coffee
