Hey guys, so, the world's still a dumpster fire, right? Just checking.

I saw that Trump deployed the National Guard to LA because of the ICE protests. California, you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost. Honestly, I can't even be surprised anymore. It's like, "Oh, he's testing the limits of power again? Cool. Pass the guac."

Newsom’s calling it an “alarming abuse of power.” Yeah, no kidding, Gavin. It’s like calling Godzilla “slightly disruptive to the downtown area.”

It’s the 21st century, and the US is about to hit the 250 year mark. The President wants to send the army, and it's so insane. We got to fix everything!

I mean, come on, guys. But the real kicker for me is the people that are siding with this insanity. That’s why these policies are being enforced. I'm going to say it again: They are putting themselves in a dangerous situation if they start to hate the United States that much.

But here's where it gets even more weird. I saw that it's "authoritarianism," but there are people who are into it? They are going to want to come to America?
That is completely insane.

I was reminded of this one time, about a guy I know. He moved from Detroit to the suburbs of Chicago to make it, but Detroit actually has everything he needs.
It’s easy, it’s safe, he can just go back! It’s right there. 

This election stuff in America is going to get even worse than it already is! I feel like in 2028 there is going to be no need to vote.

And all of this while that dude keeps saying, “We are the greatest country on Earth!” Come on, get real! I mean, sure, we invented the internet and deep-fried Oreos, but we also have a dude who wants to sic the military on protesters. It's a mixed bag, really.

Oh, and did you see that thing about a new reality show? It's called “The American”. The contestants? Immigrants. And the prize is? I know… I know… It gets better. Apparently the winner gets U.S. citizenship and the losers get a free trip home, courtesy of the National Guard. I’m not sure what’s more dystopian, the premise or the fact that somebody actually greenlit it.

But all of these protests, what does it all mean? I think the planet is at the point of no return. And I’m just supposed to sit here and read about it!

But I will be watching this all unfold with my popcorn ready. And, hey, at least it's entertaining.

I’m off to make some AI art.
Gotta stay informed, right? Good night.
