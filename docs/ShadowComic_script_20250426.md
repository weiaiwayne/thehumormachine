Good evening, patriots… or whatever you’re calling yourselves these days. I understand the official designation is now “Trump’s Loyal Subjects, Bronze Tier.” Silver requires a minimum of three family members named Barron. Gold, I believe, involves offering up your firstborn for Mar-a-Lago landscaping.

So, the Trump administration. Again. It's like that rash you thought you got rid of with that cream you bought from a guy in a trench coat. You feel good for a while, then BAM! Back with a vengeance, and this time, it brought friends.

Remember when we all laughed at the idea of a Space Force? Well, laugh no more. Generalissimo Spacey is now in charge. His first initiative? Declassifying the moon landing footage. Apparently, Neil Armstrong was secretly a deep-state operative sent to plant evidence of… global warming on the lunar surface. That’s what the inter-dimensional Q-drops are saying, anyway. And if you question it, well, there’s a new penal colony on Mars that’s *very* spacious.

Speaking of space, the border wall is finally complete. It now extends into geosynchronous orbit. The official explanation? Preventing illegal aliens from… uh… spontaneously generating in the upper atmosphere. Makes perfect sense. The only downside is that the Hubble telescope now has a slightly obstructed view of the Andromeda galaxy. But hey, national security, right?

And education! What a triumph. Betsy DeVos’s legacy lives on! Only now, it’s not just charter schools; it’s charter *universes*. Every child gets a personalized curriculum tailored to their… let’s call them “pre-approved” interests. Little Timmy gets to learn all about the glorious history of Trumpian economics, while little Tammy gets a crash course in the art of the perfect comb-over. And don’t even get me started on the new “Advanced Placement” courses. AP Patriotism? AP Alternative Facts? AP Interpretive Dance to the Constitution? The possibilities are…terrifying.

The Supreme Court is… well, it’s still the Supreme Court. Only now, the nine justices are required to wear MAGA hats during oral arguments. Apparently, it helps them “focus on the true meaning of the Constitution.” Which, according to Justice Clarence Thomas’s newly unearthed notes, is actually just a series of inspirational quotes from *The Art of the Deal*.

But let's not dwell on the judiciary. Let’s talk about the economy! Booming, they say. Absolutely booming. Thanks to the revolutionary new monetary policy: TrumpBucks. Each TrumpBuck is worth… well, whatever Trump says it’s worth that day. It's like Bitcoin, but with more hairspray and a much greater chance of being declared legal tender in North Korea.

And the media! What a bastion of unbiased reporting. Fox News is now officially the “State News Network.” CNN has been rebranded as “Trump News Network,” and MSNBC… well, let’s just say they’re currently airing a 24/7 loop of puppies and kittens. Very soothing. Very… compliant.

The Department of Justice? Oh, they're busy. Very busy. Mostly with investigating anyone who dares to criticize… well, anything. Freedom of speech is still technically a thing, but it now comes with a mandatory background check and a potential visit from the “Loyalty Enforcement Squad.” They’re very polite, but their smiles don’t quite reach their eyes.

Speaking of which, “eyes” are the new surveillance tool. Thanks to the partnership between Palantir and the Department of Homeland Security, every American citizen is now equipped with a mandatory retinal scanner. It's for "security purposes," of course. And to make sure you're not secretly binge-watching anything that doesn't feature a Trump cameo.

But hey, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are some bright spots. For example, the national bird is now the golden eagle… wearing a tiny, custom-made “Make America Great Again” hat. It’s quite adorable, actually. Unless you’re a bald eagle. Then, it’s just awkward.

And the White House! It’s been completely redecorated. Think Versailles, but with more gold plating and portraits of Trump in various historical poses. Trump as George Washington crossing the Delaware? Majestic. Trump as Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address? Inspiring. Trump as… Cleopatra? Okay, that one’s a little… unsettling.

But the best part? The best part is the unity. Everyone’s united. United in… well, in fearing the consequences of not being united. It’s a very powerful motivator. You should try it sometime.

So, there you have it. America in
