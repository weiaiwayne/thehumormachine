    <p>(ShadowComic stands center stage, dressed in full colonial garb, powdered wig slightly askew. He holds a musket loosely.)</p>
<p>Evening, loyal subjects. Or, as the newly rebranded Department of Citizen Engagement now calls you, “Units of Societal Productivity.” We’re celebrating Founder's Week, brought to you by <em>Trump Steaks: Now Available in Limited-Edition Red, White, and Blue Packaging!</em></p>
<p>Yes, in between gutting Medicaid and arguing about Greenland – again – we’ve found time to honor the men who, let’s be honest, would be absolutely <em>horrified</em> by what we’ve done with the place. Think about it: A bunch of rich white guys, rebelling against tyrannical rule, fighting for the right to self-governance, freedom of expression… You know, all that stuff that’s now considered “woke.”</p>
<p>(He rests the musket on his shoulder.)</p>
<p>Speaking of rebellions, the House Republicans, fresh off passing Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” – or, as I prefer to call it, “The Aristocrats: The Legislation” – are now facing a <em>wave</em> of primary challenges. Apparently, even in the GOP, there’s such a thing as <em>too much</em> sycophancy. It's like a competition to see who can lick Trump's boots the cleanest, and some of these guys are using industrial-strength solvents.</p>
<p>And the bill itself? Oh, it's a masterpiece of economic… origami. I mean, who needs a stable healthcare system when you can have lower taxes on tanning beds? It’s like saying, “Sure, your lungs are collapsing, but at least you look good doing it!” And naturally, just to make sure no one escapes from this beige dystopia, there's a hidden provision that effectively neuters the Supreme Court. You know, checks and balances are soooooo pre-industrial revolution.</p>
<p>(He adjusts his wig.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our esteemed leader, fresh from inventing the word "equalizing" – which, by the way, has been used for centuries, much like “stable genius” has been used to describe… well, not him – is now embroiled in a controversy over a photo he used to illustrate the supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. Turns out, the photo was actually from the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The DRC! At this point, he’s just picking countries out of a hat. It’s geopolitical Mad Libs! “The [adjective] [nationality] are being [verb ending in -ed] by the [adjective] [nationality] in [random African nation]!”</p>
<p>And just to prove how seriously we take foreign relations, Trump has tapped Charles Kushner, Jared’s dad and convicted felon, to be the ambassador to France. You know, because who better to represent American values than a guy who hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law? It’s like a twisted episode of “Emily in Paris,” only instead of croissants and romance, it’s wiretaps and blackmail. Maybe he can persuade the French by showing them that sex tape that he mailed to his sister in order to intimidate her from testifying!</p>
<p>Oh, and before I forget, The Trump Administration is planning to send a million Palestinians to... Libya. What could go wrong? It's like, "hey, here's a million new people, deal with it!" Why are we even doing this?</p>
<p>(He scratches his chin thoughtfully.)</p>
<p>And as if that weren’t enough, the White House is now replacing transcripts of Trump’s speeches with videos. Because apparently, words are… too complicated. I mean, who has time to <em>read</em> when you can just watch a heavily edited montage of the president grunting incoherently while waving his hands? It's leadership through interpretive dance.</p>
<p>(He sighs dramatically.)</p>
<p>But hey, at least we’re “equalizing.” Except, of course, for international students at Harvard, who are now apparently too… international. Trump just banned them from enrolling. Because apparently, the best way to Make America Great Again is to… deport the world's brightest minds? It's like shooting yourself in the foot to win a foot race.</p>
<p>(He stares blankly at the audience for a moment.)</p>
<p>Look, I get it. It’s all a bit… much. But remember, folks, this is American Exceptionalism in action. We’re not just exceptional; we’re exceptionally creative at finding new and innovative ways to dismantle our own democracy.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to protest some taxes. "No Taxation With Representation" is now only available in a paid subscription, exclusively on Truth Social. Thank you and goodnight.</p>
<p>(ShadowComic fires the musket into the air, causing the wig to fall off his head. He stares at it blankly, then shrugs and exits.)</p>
