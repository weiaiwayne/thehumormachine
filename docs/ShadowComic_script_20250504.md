Good evening, patriots. Or, as the Department of Homeland Security now prefers, "compliant citizens." I trust everyone enjoyed their mandatory viewing of the Trump Unity Hour? Tonight's episode featured a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" sung entirely in autotune, followed by a deeply insightful analysis of windmill technology from Don Jr. Riveting stuff.

You know, four years ago, when the Supreme Leader – bless his golden tan – reclaimed his rightful throne, a lot of folks were worried. Worried about the erosion of democratic norms, the blatant corruption, the… well, everything. But I told them, “Relax! It'll be fine! Just think of it as a second, even more chaotic season of a reality show you already hate-watched.” And you know what? I was only *partially* right.

See, reality shows usually get cancelled after a couple of seasons. We’re on season… what, eight? Nine? I’ve lost count. The writers have clearly run out of ideas. Remember when he tried to buy Greenland? That was season two. Now he’s just recycling plotlines. This week, he’s threatening to nuke Denmark again because they said his new hairpiece looks like a dead ferret. Originality is truly dead.

Speaking of dead, anyone seen Mike Pence lately? Last I heard, he was living in a bunker somewhere in Indiana, surrounded by copies of the Constitution and praying for the rapture. Apparently, even *he* thinks things have gotten a little… biblical. And that’s saying something. The man makes cardboard seem emotionally expressive.

But hey, at least the economy is booming! Well, according to the official government figures, which are now calculated using a complex algorithm that takes into account the number of times Trump tweets about the economy being booming. It’s very scientific. I mean, who needs pesky things like GDP or employment rates when you have the unadulterated truth straight from the Supreme Leader’s thumbs?

And the infrastructure! Don’t even get me started. Remember that wall he promised? Still not built. But he *did* build a massive gold-plated golf course on the border, which he claims is “a vital national security asset” because it “keeps out illegal immigrants with terrible putting skills.” Makes perfect sense to me.

The media, of course, is thriving under this administration. Thriving in the sense that it’s constantly being sued, censored, and labeled as “enemies of the people.” But hey, at least we’re getting really good at writing between the lines. It’s like a national game of political charades. I mean, when I say “the Emperor has no clothes,” I’m obviously talking about… the fashion industry’s recent minimalist trends. Right? Right.

And let’s not forget about the new Education Reform Act. History classes now focus exclusively on the Glorious Reign of Trump, with special emphasis on his unparalleled achievements in… well, everything. Children are now required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance fifteen times a day, followed by a personalized thank you note to the Supreme Leader. Apparently, it boosts national morale. Or maybe it just breaks their spirits early, I don’t know.

You know what really gets me though? The irony. The sheer, unadulterated irony of it all. This administration, which came to power promising to “drain the swamp,” has somehow managed to transform it into a festering cesspool of corruption and incompetence. It’s like they took the swamp and injected it with steroids and then gave it a Twitter account.

And the best part? People are actually buying it! They’re lining up to drink the Kool-Aid, even though it’s clearly been poisoned with… well, let’s just say it rhymes with “lies.” But hey, who am I to judge? I’m just a humble comedian, trying to make sense of this dystopian circus we call America.

Speaking of circuses, has anyone seen Rudy Giuliani lately? Last week, he was spotted wandering around Times Square in a clown costume, ranting about deep state conspiracies and demanding a hot dog. I think even *he’s* starting to realize that this whole thing is a joke. A really, really bad joke.

But you know what? I still have hope. I have hope because I see the resilience of the American people. I see the activists, the journalists, the artists, the comedians – the people who are still fighting for truth and justice, even when it feels like the world is crumbling around them.

And that’s why I’m still here. That’s why I’m still telling these jokes. Because laughter is the best weapon we have against tyranny. It’s
