    <p>(RedStateRoast, as a Gen Z coder who lives with his parents and spends way too much time online, adjusts his glasses and nervously addresses the microphone)</p>
<p>Okay, so, like, you guys seeing this whole thing with the government claiming to know everything? I swear, I open my news feed every day, and I just feel like I'm being data-mined by a bunch of out-of-touch boomers who think a "hashtag" is a pound sign.</p>
<p>(beat)</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, though, did you guys see that list of things they are gonna stop. I thought that it was just the weather. Now I hear that someone had to make up the list all by a sudden. I swear the whole place is gonna have to go and see. They even have stuff about the food we are gonna be able to eat!</p>
<p>It is a mess, folks.</p>
<p>And don't even get me started on what I saw people with their faces on. Oh, you know who I am talking about?
All over the place that the robots are taking over the world and that maybe we are all on a screen. Okay, that’s a real thing, too, but why are we supposed to care that someone is just living rent-free in my head that they just can't do? I just got told to get it off and it hurt all that’s all!</p>
<p>I mean, I’m just trying to code my way to financial freedom, live my best life, and maybe, just maybe, afford a down payment on a cardboard box in Silicon Valley. But now I gotta worry about whether the government thinks my memes are “anti-American”? I don't know about this, what are gonna do is what you can expect if you just stay right back here? They said they had a plan for all these things for the rest of your life. What are they going to do? I have the question and they are saying “I am so dumb.”</p>
<p>And honestly, with all this going on, is it any wonder that my therapist told me to “unplug” and “touch grass”? Like, lady, I'm a coder. Touching grass is literally my worst nightmare. There are bugs out there, and sunlight. Plus, how am I supposed to doomscroll if I’m not glued to my screen 24/7? That's their world now what is up there?</p>
<p>(He pauses, a look of dawning realization on his face.)</p>
<p>Wait a minute… maybe <em>that’s</em> the plan. Maybe they want us all to unplug, to disconnect, to become blissfully ignorant of the encroaching dystopia. Then, before we know it, we’ll all be living in a real-life version of <em>The Matrix</em>, except instead of Keanu Reeves, it’s Mike Lindell offering us a choice between a red pill and a MyPillow.</p>
<p>Okay, I’m officially scared. I’m going back to my basement, coding a self-aware AI that can fight back against the machines. Anyone want to join me? I’ve got pizza rolls and a spare VR headset. Just…leave your tinfoil hat at the door. I’m starting to think those things attract unwanted attention.</p>

<p>You have just read a fresh batch of Reddit posts and a web search summary about the latest US politics:</p>
<p>[Reddit summary]
Post: “I am in a dark place”: A QAnon influencer asks for help amid Trump’s turn against them</p>
<p>Top Comments:
- They did their best and look where it got them.
- 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️</p>
<p>You mean it’s almost as if joining a cult centered around a grifting, narcissistic sociopath isn’t a good idea?!? 🙄🙄🙄</p>
<p>Post: Senate to Hold Historic Vote on the Right to IVF</p>
<p>Top Comments:
- What an utterly absurd place the US has become. What the fuck!
- A bill for something that should be automatically granted and shouldn't even need a bill.
- Why is something that is so deeply personal even on the radar for politics??
- It's because Republicans need to control women's bodies.
- They hate children, women, and people who aren’t rich</p>
<p>Post: The GOP Is Already Planning Its Next Shutdown</p>
<p>Top Comments:
- Republicans can’t govern. They can only obstruct and cause chaos
- The only way to get Republicans to govern in good faith is to stop voting for them.
- Well, they've got to get back to impeaching the cartoon characters on Sesame Street, and that takes time...
- It’s the only thing they can do. They have no platform, no ideas, just sabotage and hate.
- Time to move to Norway.</p>
<p>Post: How the Trump administration is trying to manipulate statistics</p>
<p>Top Comments:
- It’s not just a means to an end for them, it’s a feature. In some ways, it’s the whole point.</p>
<p>The point is not to know the world, it’s to control your perception of it.
- It seems as though the goal of a number of administrations have been to deceive the masses on multiple fronts for political gain for a very long time.
- They want to confuse and overwhelm. The truth is far too complicated for most people to understand, but a lie is easily grasped and remembered. The goal is to have so many lies that people are simply unable to track them all, and so</p>
