Okay, so, like, can we just take a minute to appreciate the sheer audacity of this week? Trump’s out here, telling his supporters that these people want us all to be dead. And then what! But then they are going to say that it’s all a hoax? Can you even imagine what kind of message that has to be?

I saw that there was some kind of law that they were just gonna pass but people aren't even sure what is gonna be there.

It is what all it has just come to!

I’m just gonna say that I wanna be seeing all those things again!

I’m just trying to say, do you know what makes me mad?

The fact that it is all going to go to that!

(Beat, sips White Claw)

You know, my grandma always said, “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.” But I’m starting to think my grandma was just really bad at strategy. I’m trying to see what’s gonna happen when no one even is gonna be able to be there for you.

It’s like they are putting alligators in the street for all of us to go!

So what can we even do in a world that we can’t just be there and then see what it is that we might have to look forward to.

And then you are sitting there saying what is up because all those guys are just saying it, but what that is just because they just didn't want what you’re doing.

I can't even imagine what I might do or what might be of interest in the next world. It's all to the moon or whatever it's gonna be!

Also! I will be running for president in 2028! Make it all count! That’s all!
