Good evening, and welcome back to “Truthiness: Declassified.” Or, as the Department of Homeland Security prefers to call it, “Subversive Propaganda Hour.” But hey, who are they to judge? They're busy enough trying to figure out how to weaponize TikTok dances.

So, another week, another dumpster fire of democracy. You know, back in 2020, we all thought, "Well, *that* was a weird dream. Wake me up when it's over." Turns out, we were just hitting snooze. Now it's 2025, and the alarm clock is permanently stuck on “Make America Great… Again… Again… Again… This Time We Really Mean It!”

And speaking of alarm clocks, did you hear about the new executive order? All public clocks must now be set five minutes ahead, because, quote, "America must be first… even in time." Apparently, our national ego can’t handle the idea that New Zealand sees the sunrise before we do. I’m just waiting for the inevitable lawsuit from Big Sundial.

But let's not dwell on the petty tyranny. Let’s talk policy! Remember that infrastructure bill everyone was so excited about? Yeah, turns out "infrastructure" in Trump-speak means a solid gold border wall… around Mar-a-Lago. And the new high-speed rail? It only runs between Trump Tower and the nearest golf course. Eco-friendly, though. Powered by the tears of liberals.

And healthcare? Don’t even get me started. The new plan, "TrumpCare 3.0: Now With Even More Bling!" promises to cover "pre-existing conditions… like being a Democrat." And instead of doctors, you get a personalized consultation with a hologram of Ivanka. She’ll sell you essential oils. It’s preventative care, apparently. Prevents you from questioning the regime.

Education is thriving, by the way. History textbooks have been rewritten to portray Trump as a cross between George Washington and a really tanned unicorn. Critical Race Theory has been replaced with "Critical Trump Theory," which basically involves memorizing his tweets and reciting them at dawn. Participation trophies are mandatory. Gold-plated, of course.

And the Supreme Court? Well, let's just say they're not exactly known for their groundbreaking legal interpretations these days. Their latest ruling? That cats are now officially considered emotional support animals… for Supreme Court justices. I’m guessing that’s a subtle dig at Clarence Thomas. Meow.

But fear not, patriots! Resistance is not futile! It’s just… extremely well-documented by the NSA. We’re finding creative ways to protest. Like, instead of wearing pink pussy hats, we’re now wearing hats shaped like… moderately priced, ethically sourced, and locally grown vegetables. The lettuce brigade, we call ourselves. We're hoping to trigger his aversion to anything remotely resembling a healthy lifestyle.

And speaking of resistance, the Democrats are… well, they're still trying to figure out what happened in 2016. They're holding workshops on "How to Appeal to Rural Voters Without Actually Leaving Manhattan." Good luck with that, guys. Maybe try offering free artisanal coffee and gluten-free donuts. That'll win 'em over.

Meanwhile, the Republican party has fully embraced its destiny as a reality TV show. They're currently holding auditions for Trump's running mate in 2028. The frontrunners? A ventriloquist dummy, a sentient AI chatbot that only speaks in MAGA slogans, and… Rudy Giuliani. Just when you thought he couldn't embarrass himself further, he's back. Like a bad rash.

But here’s the thing, folks. Even in this dystopian reality show, there’s still room for hope. People are waking up. They're starting to question the narrative. They're realizing that maybe, just maybe, a country run by a narcissistic reality TV star isn't the best idea since sliced bread. Although, knowing this administration, they’ll probably find a way to tax sliced bread next.

And that, my friends, is where we come in. We, the purveyors of truthiness, the champions of satire, the last line of defense against the encroaching darkness. We may be under surveillance. We may be censored. We may be forced to broadcast from a secret bunker under a laundromat. But we will not be silenced!

Because laughter, you see, is the most potent weapon against tyranny. It'
