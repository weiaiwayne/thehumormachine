Evening, patriots. Or… whatever you are. I'm still trying to figure out if "citizen" is even a valid legal term anymore. I think it's been replaced by "compliant data node" in the latest executive order.

So, I just came from a town hall meeting in… let's call it "Flyover, USA," because admitting the actual location might trigger a drone strike. The topic? The proposed "Patriotism Re-Education Camps." Yeah, you heard that right. Camps. Like summer camp, but instead of learning how to make friendship bracelets, you learn how to properly salute a flag emblazoned with Trump's face. I hear arts and crafts hour involves making miniature walls out of popsicle sticks and nationalist fervor.

The administration’s calling it a “proactive measure to combat misinformation.” Which, in this context, means anything that doesn’t directly originate from Truth Social. I overheard one woman saying she was excited because her grandson would finally learn "real history," like how the Earth is flat and Hillary Clinton runs a pizza parlor out of the Oval Office. I considered correcting her, but then I remembered that disagreeing with someone in public is now considered a hate crime, punishable by… well, I don’t know exactly. Probably something involving Tucker Carlson and a waterboarding technique using Mountain Dew.

And speaking of Truth Social, did you see Trump’s latest rant? Apparently, the squirrels in Mar-a-Lago are conspiring against him. He claims they’re planting tiny listening devices in his toupee. I’m not making this up. He literally tweeted, in all caps, "THE SQUIRRELS ARE TRAITORS! FAKE NEWS SQUIRRELS!" I mean, at this point, who needs satire? The man is a self-parodying masterpiece. He’s like performance art, if the art was a dumpster fire fueled by ego and spray tan.

The really terrifying part is, his base eats it up. They see him ranting about squirrels and they think, "Finally! Someone who understands my struggles!" It's like we're living in an alternate reality where the sanity test involves agreeing that rodents are part of a deep state conspiracy.

But hey, at least the economy is… doing something. I’m not entirely sure what. I think it's mostly propped up by the sale of "Make America Great Again" gold-plated toilet plungers. They’re selling like hotcakes. Apparently, there's a huge demand for symbols of both patriotism and…well, you know. It's a very on-the-nose metaphor, if you think about it.

And then there’s the ongoing investigation into… everything. They're investigating Biden, Obama, Clinton, the Easter Bunny, probably me after this set. The charges are always vague, usually involving "treasonous activities" or "failure to properly admire the Trump brand." They’ve even subpoenaed the ghost of George Washington. I’m not kidding. Apparently, he’s suspected of spreading "anti-Trump propaganda" through… seances? I don’t know. The details are sketchy. But I’m sure Fox News will have a panel of experts dissecting it for the next three weeks.

The Justice Department, which now operates out of a converted Arby’s, is working overtime. I heard they’re thinking of replacing the scales of justice with a giant, golden Trump bobblehead. It tilts slightly to the right, naturally.

Oh, and remember that whole thing about climate change? Yeah, that’s… gone. Officially. The administration has declared that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by… wait for it… radical leftist penguins. Apparently, they’ve been melting the ice caps with their… penguin lasers? I don’t know, man. I’m just reporting the news here. Don’t shoot the messenger. Especially if the messenger is wearing a flak jacket and carrying a concealed copy of the Constitution.

The good news is, the Patriot Police are cracking down on… well, pretty much everything. But especially public displays of… emotion. Smiling is now considered suspicious. Crying is definitely a sign of disloyalty. The only acceptable facial expression is a blank, vaguely terrified stare. Think of it as the Mona Lisa, but with more existential dread.

I did see one act of rebellion the other day. Someone spray-painted "Resist" on a billboard featuring Trump's face. The Patriot Police were on the scene within minutes. They scrubbed off the word "Resist" and replaced it with "Re-elect." Problem solved. Democracy saved.

You know, I used to think that history rhymed. Now I’m pretty sure it’s just repeating itself, but this time with more reality TV stars and less common sense. It’s like we’re trapped in a never-ending episode of *The Twilight Zone*, but instead of Rod Serling, we have Steve Bannon as the narrator. And instead of a twist ending, we just have… more Trump.

So, yeah. That’s the state of the union. Or, you know, whatever this… *thing*… is we’re living in now. I'm thinking of starting a support group for people suffering from "Trump Derangement Syndrome." But I'm afraid the government will declare it a terrorist organization.

On the bright side, at least the kombucha prices have stabilized. For now.
