**(Lights up on SHADOWCOMIC, perched on a stool, a half-eaten bag of "Dr. AI's Miracle Cure" trail mix beside them.)**

Good evening, patriots…or what’s left of you. I’m ShadowComic, and tonight we’re diving headfirst into the shimmering, festering swamp that is American politics, circa…whenever the hell this is.

First up, Representative Shri Thanedar. Bless his heart. He tried. He *really* tried to impeach the Tangerine Tyrant. Seven articles! That’s, like, almost as many wives as the guy has. But…alas, Thanedar, the human embodiment of good intentions paved with legislative gridlock, was thwarted. The Democratic leadership, those paragons of…uh…strategic…prudence, teamed up with the Republicans to kill the vote. Why? Well, according to the official statement, Trump has since committed even *more* impeachable offenses, rendering the original charges…quaint. Like calling a 10-megaton bomb "slightly disruptive".

It's genius, really. Keep creating new crimes faster than we can prosecute the old ones. Soon, the sheer volume of malfeasance will collapse in on itself, creating a black hole of accountability where Trump can safely golf for eternity. I can see the historical marker now: "Here lies the singularity of justice, forever overshadowed by a really tacky golden tower."

And speaking of gold, let’s talk tariffs, shall we? Treasury Secretary Pam Bondi, that legal eagle who once valiantly defended the sanctity of Trump University, apparently dumped a few million in Trump Media stock *the very day* the Orange One unleashed his latest volley of economic…let's call them "incentives." Coincidence? Of course not! It was divine intervention! Clearly, the invisible hand of the free market is guided by tiny, orange fingers.

Bondi, by the way, is just one example from the hall of fame of Trump’s inner circle. I heard he is thinking of having his cabinet members all wear jerseys like a NASCAR driver. Lots of sponsors, mostly middle eastern countries and Russian petroleum. He'll be the official pace car, naturally, a solid-gold golf cart with a "Don't Tread on Me" flag duct-taped to the back.

But back to our tariffs. Walmart, that beacon of affordable…ish living, is warning of price hikes. Because, as we all know, tariffs are paid by…uh…China. Right? That’s what they told us in 2016, and I see no reason to question it now. I mean, who are you going to believe? Your lying eyes, or a man who claims to have invented the wheel…after being told about it?

Now, there’s that little dustup with the Library of Congress. Apparently, Trump wants it. All of it. Every musty tome, every Dewey Decimal, every overdue notice. It's not enough to rewrite the future; he wants to control the past, too. Which is ironic, given his complete inability to remember what happened last Tuesday. I bet in the new Trump version of the library, history books will just be copies of *The Art of the Deal* with the chapter on bankruptcy strategically ripped out.

And here's a cheerful thought: ICE Barbie, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, refused to confirm whether a gay makeup artist is even *alive* after being disappeared to one of those charming El Salvadorian prisons. "Not my problem," she said. Because, you know, human rights are so…yesterday. It’s all about tough love and…extrajudicial…relocation. I’m pretty sure that's in the Bible somewhere.

But hey, it’s not all doom and gloom! At least Bruce Springsteen is still around to call out the “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous” Trump Administration. Of course, half his fan base probably thinks he’s a traitor now, but hey, at least The Boss hasn’t sold his soul…yet. I hear there’s a lucrative offer from Truth Social to write a jingle for Trump Coin. It would just be the chorus to "Born in the USA" but with the word "MAGA" replacing the title.

Which brings me to the last thing on the pile, another case about birthright citizenship is heading to the Supreme Court. I thought we settled this centuries ago, but I guess the phrase “all men are created equal” now comes with an asterisk, a superscript, and a 40-page disclaimer in legalese that only Leonard Leo can decipher.

Folks, I'm not saying the sky is falling. I’m just saying it’s leaking radioactive waste, infested with AI-generated locusts, and about to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. But hey, look on the bright side! At least Dr. AI is seeing patients now! I asked it about the lump on my neck, and it said, "That's a perfectly normal side effect of living in 2025. Try more Steak Sauce".

**(ShadowComic looks directly into the camera, smirks, and tosses the empty trail mix bag into the darkness.)**

Goodnight, and may the odds be ever in your favor…of not being disappeared.
