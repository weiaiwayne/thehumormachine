Don't worry, it's not for *me*. It's to protect the mic. Can't be too careful these days. The 5G's got a mind of its own. RFK Jr. told me himself. Just after the dolphin autopsy.

(Pauses, adjusting his tie)

So, I’ve been following the news. Which, at this point, is less "news" and more "performance art by sociopaths." And let me tell you, the reviews are… mixed.

First off, Pakistan. Balochistan declaring independence? What is it with nations lately? Everyone's pulling a Brexit. I fully expect Texas to declare independence by next Tuesday. They’ll probably rename it "Greater Trumpylvania" and immediately start deporting Californians. The flag will be a giant cowboy boot crushing a avocado.

But the real head-scratcher this week is the decapitated dolphin. A federal crime, apparently. Twenty grand reward. I'm picturing some grizzled, seen-it-all marine biologist, muttering, "Twenty grand… that's not even enough for the therapy I'm gonna need after this."

And of course, Reddit. Bless their hearts. They immediately jumped to the obvious conclusion: RFK Jr. Did it. With his bare hands. While swimming in raw sewage.

(Leans into the mic conspiratorially)

Look, I’m not saying he *did* it. I’m just saying… has anyone checked his minivan? I mean, the guy thinks vaccines cause autism. A decapitated dolphin is practically a logical next step. It's like going from amateur hour to a performance at the Kennedy Center. The raw sewage is a nice touch, though. Really ties the whole thing together. Method acting, you know?

And then there’s the rumor that Trump… well, let's just say he had a *close encounter* of the third kind with the deceased cetacean. I’m not even going to touch that one. Some things are too sacred to satirize. And by "sacred," I mean "too disturbing to even contemplate without requiring a month of intensive therapy and a lifetime supply of brain bleach." But the fact that people *believe* this… that's the real punchline.

Speaking of punchlines, UnitedHealth is under criminal investigation for Medicare fraud. Medicare fraud! The one thing that unites Republicans and Democrats: ripping off the elderly. It’s like the one bipartisan initiative left in this country.

They're sending unsolicited Cologuard tests to people. Six or seven times. I’m picturing some poor, elderly woman, drowning in a sea of cardboard boxes filled with colorectal cancer screening kits. She probably thinks it’s a sign from God. Or maybe just a very aggressive marketing campaign. Either way, she's probably going to end up with a colonoscopy whether she wants one or not. It's like a forced enema of capitalism.

They'll get a slap on the wrist, of course. A measly fine. A sternly worded letter from a senator who's probably invested in UnitedHealth. And then they’ll lay off a few thousand employees to make up for the loss. It’s the circle of life. Except instead of lions and gazelles, it’s CEOs and unemployed healthcare workers.

But here’s the real genius move: buy some Trump crypto, and the probe magically disappears. It’s like a reverse money laundering scheme. You start with dirty money, run it through the Trump grift machine, and it comes out smelling like… well, still dirty money, but at least it's *patriotic* dirty money.

And finally, Boy Hits Car. The band, not an actual crime. Although, in some neighborhoods, the former might be considered the latter. Their concert was canceled because a truck hit the venue. The Whisky A Go Go, no less. It’s like a Spinal Tap outtake written by Franz Kafka.

The headlines are pure poetry: "Truck Hits Whisky A Go Go; Boy Hits Car Show A No-Go." I mean, come on. You can’t make this stuff up. Unless you’re a satirist, in which case, you can. And I just did.

I’m starting to think the universe has a sense of humor. A dark, twisted, incredibly cynical sense of humor. It’s like we’re all characters in a cosmic sitcom, written by a committee of nihilistic chimpanzees. And the punchline?

(Looks directly into the camera with a weary smile)

We’re it.
