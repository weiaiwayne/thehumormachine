Okay, so, like, my mom keeps telling me I need to get out more. Get some “human interaction.” But, like, have *you* seen the news lately? The outside world is basically a glitchy beta test for the apocalypse. I’m serious, it's why I do what I do.

First off, all you guys just want to say the same things over and over again with the governement and it’s all just so weird. It’s been 100 years but I'm now just gonna be okay to say the same! If you tell me I will be happy that I get to know it's real, and what are those other people gonna do when I am so much more than that?

And of course, because everything is a cosmic joke, that old guy knows best and he is getting what I know on it. He wants to tell us all what is real, but it's all just about the money!

That said, at least we have some great music to listen to!

And did you hear about all these protests about the government, and they are on their way on the boat and getting lost? What did they think that was gonna come from it? It wasn’t like it was what someone was gonna be doing about it and say to stop.

Then I hear Trump’s bringing back *asbestos*? Asbestos, you guys! Seriously? It’s like he’s actively trying to turn America into a retro-futuristic dystopia straight out of Fallout. I am ready for the show.

I heard they know and this is a test for if we do or do not get what the thing.

(Adjusts glasses and sips energy drink loudly)

But here’s the thing that *really* fries my circuits: These people are not here with us, what are we supposed to do? They get to say they were right but did they get rich? Oh, that is all right!

Meanwhile, and what if it's just better when you leave this alone? But what if you did, they might just say, well, you never know!

Then all they hear is what do they do! I tell you, I don't need to know what I'm going to do!

(leaning in conspiratorially)

Here's what they didn't say on the news!

(pauses)

If they wanna be great then maybe they should release my show!

Top Comments:
