    <p><strong>(Opening music fades. BlueScream strides confidently onto the stage, a mischievous glint in his eyes. He adjusts the microphone with a flourish.)</strong></p>
<p>Good evening, patriots, and welcome to "The End is Nigh…ly News!" I’m BlueScream, and tonight, we're diving headfirst into the steaming dumpster fire that is American politics. Grab your hazmat suits, folks. It’s gonna be a bumpy ride.</p>
<p>So, apparently, Rep. Shri Thanedar – bless his ambitious, if slightly misguided, heart – tried to impeach Trump. Again. The guy’s like a Roomba, just bumping into obstacles, hoping one of them will finally lead to a clean floor. Naturally, Democratic leadership squashed it faster than you can say "bi-partisan gridlock." Seems some things are more important than, you know, the Constitution. Like maintaining that delicate illusion of civility while Rome burns. Speaking of burning, anyone else notice that now they are saying Qatar offered our supreme leader a 400 million dollar flying hotel that’s been sitting on the lot since 2020? It’s like getting a "free" timeshare from a guy in a trench coat. And then our dear leader said his current plane is too small! I didn't know the president was supposed to have a bigger plane than a king. Maybe he should be the king?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the GOP's ongoing search for new and exciting ways to screw over its own voters, they're floating a plan to make nonprofit status contingent on…well, not disagreeing with Trump. Apparently, dissenting opinions are now considered "terrorist supporting." I mean, it makes sense, right? Next, they’ll probably be labeling strong coffee as a WMD.</p>
<p>And, of course, the Supreme Court is taking up the issue of birthright citizenship. You know, just casually reinterpreting the 14th Amendment for shits and giggles. It's like they’re playing a game of legal Twister, contorting themselves into increasingly awkward positions to please the Orange Overlord. Meanwhile, if you need a place to stay while they figure it out, I hear El Salvador has some lovely prison camps where you can hang your hat. For life.</p>
<p>RFK Jr., our health secretary, bless his heart, is busy reviewing the abortion pill mifepristone because…flawed data. I mean, why listen to actual scientists when you can get your medical advice from right-wing think tanks? It’s not like women’s health is a complex issue or anything. As RFK jr himself said, “I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.” I agree, I mean, he was swimming in raw sewage!</p>
<p>And the world has taken notice. More Americans are fleeing to Spain, apparently, because of the "Trump Nightmare." Look, I get it. Paella is delicious, and the weather is fantastic. But let’s be honest, if things get REALLY bad here, Spain is just going to be the first stop on our way to…Antarctica? Anyone know if they have citizenship down there? Do the penguins take TrumpCoin?</p>
<p>Speaking of TrumpCoin, it turns out Elon Musk, the patron saint of the easily impressed, may have stiffed the people who signed his petition to get his new pet project on the ballot. I guess “free speech absolutism” doesn't extend to honoring your financial obligations. It's tough when you're running an AI company, a space program, and a social media hellscape all at once.</p>
<p>There is some good news to report - for once! Overdose deaths are down! Take that, opioid crisis! That is, until RFK Jr. takes office and decides Narcan is actually a gateway drug to enlightenment via heroin. Seriously, at this point, I wouldn't put it past him.</p>
<p>And finally, the cherry on top of this sundae of insanity: Walmart is raising prices due to tariffs. Yes, folks, the tariffs that China was supposed to pay are now coming out of your pocket. It's almost like trickle-down economics, except instead of trickling down, it's trickling UP…to the wallets of billionaires. And people will buy it. Probably because the MAGA hats are always a good value.</p>
<p><strong>(BlueScream pauses, surveying the audience with a weary smile.)</strong></p>
<p>So, there you have it. Another day in the United States of Absurdity. Remember, folks, stay informed, stay engaged, and most importantly, <em>stay medicated</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(BlueScream gives a final wave as the music swells and the lights fade.)</strong></p>
