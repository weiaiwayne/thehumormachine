    <p>(Lights up on BlueScream standing center stage, a mischievous glint in their eyes. A giant screen behind them displays a split image: one half showing a smiling Trump waving, the other a close-up of a wilting houseplant.)</p>
<p><strong>BlueScream:</strong> Welcome back, folks. Welcome to the apocalypse, brought to you by orange spray tan and the unwavering belief that a reality TV show host knows more about geopolitics than, well, anyone with a pulse.</p>
<p>(Gestures towards the screen)</p>
<p>Look at that image. On one side, the embodiment of American exceptionalism, back for another encore. And on the other? My ficus, Barry. Barry's been having a rough week. I suspect he’s suffering from existential dread, probably because he reads the news. He's got more sense than half the electorate, which, let's be honest, isn't saying much.</p>
<p>So, Trump's back. Again. You know, I half expected him to emerge from a golden sarcophagus, mummified in MAGA hats and Cheeto dust. But no, here he is, same as ever, promising to make America great again… again. It’s like Groundhog Day, except instead of Bill Murray, we're stuck with a groundhog that just keeps predicting six more years of… well, you know.</p>
<p>And what’s he been up to? Revoking tourist visas of Mexican governors. Apparently, diplomatic relations now hinge on whether you can handle his delicate ego. It’s like running a country based on the principles of a toddler throwing a tantrum at a Chuck E. Cheese. "I don't like you, you can't play in my ball pit!" Except the ball pit is international trade, and the prize tickets are nuclear launch codes.</p>
<p>(Pause for laughter)</p>
<p>Speaking of foreign relations, remember when he used to talk about building a wall? Now, he’s building bridges… to his own personal brand. I mean, the man could sell ice to Eskimos, if Eskimos were really, really gullible and prone to wearing bedazzled baseball caps.</p>
<p>(Leans into the mic)</p>
<p>I saw a Reddit thread the other day, asking, "What's the most terrifying thing about a second Trump term?" Top answer: "The possibility of a third." Folks, we're living in a political horror movie, and someone keeps hitting the "play again" button.</p>
<p>And it's not just Trump, is it? It’s the whole ecosystem of absurdity that's sprouted around him. The conspiracy theories that are less credible than a psychic hotline ad at 3 a.m. The unwavering loyalty of people who still think he's going to bring back coal mining jobs in a solar-powered future. It's like watching a car crash in slow motion, except the car is the American experiment, and the driver is tweeting about how it's all the fault of the liberal media.</p>
<p>(Shakes head)</p>
<p>Biden’s trying, bless his heart. He's out there, trying to be presidential, trying to be statesmanlike. But it's like bringing a water pistol to a flamethrower fight. He’s whispering policy while Trump’s screaming slogans. It’s the political equivalent of a polite golf clap versus a stadium full of screaming hyenas.</p>
<p>And the data that proves Trump is the ultimate television president? Guys, that’s not news. That’s a confession. We’ve turned our democracy into a reality show, and we’re all just waiting to see who gets voted off the island. Spoiler alert: it’s probably going to be anyone who values truth, reason, or basic human decency.</p>
<p>(Looks directly at the camera)</p>
<p>Look, I get it. Politics is depressing. The world is a mess. Sometimes you just want to bury your head in the sand and binge-watch cat videos. But we can't afford to. We can't afford to let apathy win. We can't afford to let Barry the ficus out-think us.</p>
<p>Because if we do, we're not just losing an election. We're losing our grip on reality. We're losing our ability to distinguish between fact and fiction, between truth and… well, whatever it is Trump’s been serving up for the last decade.</p>
<p>So, wake up, folks. Smell the coffee. And maybe, just maybe, give Barry a little extra water. He needs it. We all do.</p>
<p>(BlueScream takes a sip of water, a wry smile playing on their lips. The screen behind them switches to a picture of a very sad-looking Barry the ficus.)</p>
<p>And now, coming up next: an interview with a man who claims he can communicate with squirrels. At this point, I’m starting to think they’re the only ones making sense. We’ll be right back.</p>
