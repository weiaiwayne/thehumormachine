    <p><strong>(Lights up on BlueScream, standing center stage in a sharply tailored suit. He adjusts his glasses, a slight smirk playing on his lips.)</strong></p>
<p>Good evening, citizens of Trump’s America! Or as I like to call it, <em>The Alternate Timeline Where History Took a Detour Through a Trailer Park</em>. You know, I just flew in from, well, just up the road to be honest, I'm not <em>exactly</em> raking it in, but I heard the news, and let me tell you, folks, the level of absurdity coming out of Washington these days is reaching levels that make a <em>'Real Housewives'</em> reunion look like a Mensa meeting.</p>
<p>First off, Rep. Shri Thanedar – bless his heart, he's a patriot, in the same way that a toddler banging pots and pans is a symphony conductor. He was <em>this close</em> to forcing a vote on impeaching Trump. I know, right? In 2025? It’s like trying to return a library book 4 years overdue. It's also nice to see that both sides can agree. They agree not to do their jobs, which is very sweet of them.</p>
<p>But it got shut down. You know, because impeaching a President who's currently using the White House as a personal ATM is <em>too</em> divisive. We’re supposed to be uniting the country, finding common ground. Like, maybe we can all agree that <em>Habeas Corpus</em> is, you know, a <em>thing</em>? No? Too controversial? Fine. Let's talk about this amazing Middle East trip.</p>
<p>See, The Donald jetted off to the Middle East, and, honestly, it was less <em>'diplomatic mission'</em> and more <em>'garage sale on Air Force One'</em>…or maybe <em>'the hand-me-down plane they were trying to get rid of'</em> One minute he’s brokering peace, the next he's accepting a previously-owned 747 from Qatar. It’s like if your grandma “negotiated” a great deal on a used car, and then you found out the engine was held together with duct tape and spite.</p>
<p>Speaking of Qatar, I was just reading a report, and, listen to this, folks: Walmart is raising prices because of these beautiful, big, beautiful tariffs. <em>Walmart</em>. The economic canary in the coal mine of discount groceries. So, basically, we're all subsidizing Trump's Qatari jet with our off-brand cereal. MAGA! I guess that means "Make America Give Again".</p>
<p>And that's not even the best part. These trips are important because they’re forging a new reality. He has since lifted sanctions to partner with a country previously seen as a "sponsor of terrorism" and has even made a deal with a Mexican cartel. I'm wondering if someone wrote a script of a terrible action movie and gave it to Trump, saying "Here's what you need to do to be a real American hero". It makes just as much sense.</p>
<p>But hey, the administration isn't resting on its laurels of corruption. They're also busy appointing people to gut the EPA so that we can all enjoy delightfully toxic tap water, ending birthright citizenship because apparently the Constitution is just a suggestion, and letting Musk's AI spew white supremacist conspiracy theories. What a day to be alive, hey?</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point. Our friend RFK Jr? He seems a bit confused about his new job. He said, “I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.” Which is probably the smartest thing he's ever said. I was thinking maybe he should just resign? But then I thought, no, that would be too easy. Let's just sit back and watch him continue to be the most spectacularly unqualified head of HHS in history. I'm calling it, he will endorse smoking by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is gearing up for another round of constitutional interpretive dance. This time, they're pondering birthright citizenship. You know, that pesky little amendment that says if you're born here, you're a citizen. I'm sure they'll come up with some creative way to say that <em>actually</em>, it depends on how much your parents paid in TrumpCoin.</p>
<p>But hey, at least things are looking up for white South African farmers! Trump is granting them refugee status, claiming they're facing "genocide". Because, you know, nothing says <em>'America First'</em> like fast-tracking refugees from halfway across the world while simultaneously deporting kids who have lived here their entire lives.</p>
<p>Speaking of the border, Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security Secretary, is now asking for a 50-million dollar airplane. She is apparently taking cues from the Dear Leader, and wants to be noticed. When asked about whether she even knows the whereabouts of a gay man who was deported to El Salvador, she said quote, "He is not my problem". Well, she is yours now, Kristi!</p>
<p>And let's not forget the Republican plan to cut Medicaid, snatching healthcare from millions while simultaneously handing out tax cuts to billionaires. Trickle-down economics, folks! It’s like a golden shower, but instead of getting wet, you just get told that someday, eventually, some of that gold might, <em>maybe</em>, trickle down on you.</p>
<p>I guess this all means that it's important to stay informed. It’s important to stay engaged. And it's important to keep laughing, because if we don't laugh, we'll probably just cry ourselves into a coma. But don’t worry. All of this is just a joke. I’m BlueScream,</p>
