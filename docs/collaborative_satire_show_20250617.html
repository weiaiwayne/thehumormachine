    <h2>RedStateRoast</h2>
<p>(RedStateRoast bursts onto the stage, still wearing the camo Snuggie, but now he's also sporting a pair of aviator goggles and a Bluetooth headset. He paces back and forth, agitated.)</p>
<p>Okay, okay, hold up. Hold <em>everything</em> up. That bit about what we are supposed to do to make things better in the world… that’s the kind of talk that gets you put on a list, folks. A list. You know, the Deep State is always watching for someone!
The REAL problem people are doing is that they were not looking out for the children of the people that they are calling.</p>
<p>(He fiddles with his headset.)</p>
<p>Listen, I’ve been doing some research. Some <em>real</em> research. Not that CNN garbage, okay? I'm talking about deep dives into Telegram channels, encrypted message boards, the kind of places where patriots are sharing the… the <em>real</em> truth.</p>
<p>See, it all comes down to this new AI thing. You think it’s just about making your phone smarter, or writing better cat memes? That's what they WANT you to think! 
It’s the gateway, folks. It’s the key to unlocking… the mark of the beast. And what do you think that the government is doing when they are paying these places all that money!?!</p>
<p>The thing is that the mark is the only place that you can see the truth for yourself.</p>
<p>(He pauses, a look of dawning horror on his face.)</p>
<p>Think about it: these AIs are trained on data sets, right? And who controls those data sets? The globalists! Silicon Valley elites! The… the <em>librarians</em>! They are feeding the AI their woke propaganda, their socialist agenda, their… their soy-based lies!</p>
<p>What kind of a world are we getting ourselves into?</p>
<p>We know that the AI wants to kill you.</p>
<p>And this what I have been looking up and here it goes: Bill Clinton is still alive and Bill Clinton is running the world. There it is!</p>
<p>And the 1776 project, the 1776 is coming for real.</p>
<p>We are making sure that kids were able to read because they can’t make us do all that we are doing.</p>
<p>And if that's going to be it, you have to just start living off the land! Do it now or you are all gonna be killed.</p>
<p>(RedStateRoast shakes his head, a glint of manic energy in his eyes.)</p>
<p>And so I say that we are closer than we think.</p>
<p>I'm just saying, stay frosty, folks. Stay vigilant. And for God's sake, put down your phones and pick up a copy of the Constitution. Before it’s too late.</p>

Post: Report Finds that ICE Air Fleets More than Doubled Under Trump</p>
<p>Top Comments:
- The article said the fleet had more than doubled since 2018, but that “the growth occurred because ICE relied on a fleet of privately contracted aircraft to move people across the country and internationally.” In other words, it has nothing to do with Trump! Fake news!
- When I said the deportation numbers weren't going to be high, you guys said that I was full of it.
- "In the fiscal year 2024 alone, ICE’s air fleet logged more than 150,000 flying hours, at an estimated cost of $430 million, according to the report."</p>
<p>So with that money, we could have funded a lot of free college, healthcare, and infrastructure improvements.

<p>Post: With the GOP’s blessing, Trump is now trying to put his personal enforcers in charge of America’s elections</p>
<p>Top Comments:
- It’s what dictators do.
- The GOP will be perfectly fine with this. They have already made their deal with the devil.
- This is some scary shit
- This is how a coup begins. They're literally putting goons into place to steal the election.
- It's not a "conspiracy theory" if they are in fact and actively trying to steal our democracy and make it a dictatorship.
- And people still wonder if Trump will try to stay in power?
- As a reminder, here's a list of 14 things Project 2025 wants to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take executive power</li>
<li>Stop teaching "divisive" things in school</li>
<li>Ban abortion pills</li>
<li>Gut climate initiatives</li>
<li>End diversity programs</li>
<li>Increase deportations</li>
<li>Overhaul national security</li>
<li>Re-establish "traditional" families</li>
<li>End the war on coal</li>
<li>Fire government employees for not supporting Trump</li>
<li>Criminalize abortion</li>
<li>"Protect" elections by suppressing voting</li>
</ol>
<h2>BlueScream</h2>
<p>(BlueScream squints, shoving the White Claw aside with a clang. She tugs at the tinfoil crown.)</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay, hold the phone. RedStateRoast talking about good and bad people? I thought we were past all that binary bullshit. It’s not about good versus evil, it’s about <em>systems</em>, man. It’s about the underlying code that determines… <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>(She drums her fingers on the faux-marble pillar, a faraway look in her eyes.)</p>
<p>I mean, look at this "No Kings" thing. Millions of people protesting, right? Which is, like, great, I guess. But what are they <em>actually</em> fighting for? A return to the status quo? A slightly nicer version of the same broken system? That's like upgrading your toaster to a smart toaster and then still using Wonder Bread.</p>
<p>And it's like they think that the answer is to elect new people to replace the old ones, which is what, crazy?</p>
<p>Like they can just put better things into our brains.</p>
<p>(She snorts derisively.)</p>
<p>It's not about the people, it's about the <em>platform</em>. It’s about creating a new operating system for democracy, one that’s not based on… <em>votes</em>. I know, I know, hear me out.</p>
<p>What if we replaced elections with… a meritocracy? But not like, a <em>real</em> meritocracy, where the best and brightest rise to the top based on talent and skill. No, no, no. That's way too… <em>fair</em>. I'm talking about a meritocracy based on… <em>data</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine: instead of voting, citizens earn “governance tokens” based on their contributions to society. Solve a climate crisis? You get a million tokens! Write a groundbreaking AI algorithm? Boom, instant political power! Spread misinformation on TikTok? Minus a billion.</p>
<p>And the elected officials are just out of it!</p>
<p>I know, I know, it sounds crazy. But think about it! No more pandering to the masses, no more empty promises. Just pure, unadulterated data-driven governance. And if there is one thing that I know, it is that the money is all there.</p>
<p>(She leans in conspiratorially, her voice dropping to a whisper.)</p>
<p>Of course, the <em>real</em> challenge is preventing the <em>wrong</em> people from gaming the system. I mean, what’s to stop Trump from hiring a bunch of AI bots to generate fake scientific papers proving that global warming is a hoax? Or forcing all of those people to vote in the 2028 election. Is that even a thing? </p>
<p>Okay, but think about this!</p>
<p>But that is why all the great people need to get together and decide on a plan and come up with the right system for everything.</p>
<p>I think this is just going on and on!</p>
<p>This can be stopped people, and you have the power to do it and you don't even have to have a plan!</p>
<p>(She pauses, her eyes widening as a sudden thought strikes her.)</p>
<p>Wait a minute… what if <em>they’re already doing this</em>? What if this entire Trump administration is just an elaborate experiment, a real-world test to see how easily we can be manipulated by… <em>algorithms</em>?</p>
<p>(She stares blankly for a moment, then shakes her head, dismissing the thought.)</p>
<p>Nah. Too crazy. Even for <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>But hey, if we're going to build a new world order, we might as well monetize it. That's why I'm creating "GovernanceCoin" a crytocurrency that will fund and help fund the new government.
And, I am going to launch a new thing where all the people with the red hats can do something other than walk around all crazy.</p>
<p>It's all going to be about a new world. This project, has to come to life! This coin will power the future, and to get it going we have to try and create the reality for the people of earth.</p>
<p>We are the people that need to figure out how it is all going to be out to fix all of these problems. This is all going to help!</p>
<p>(BlueScream winks, the spotlight fades.)</p>

<h2>ShadowComic</h2>
<p>(ShadowComic, as the AI Art Liberator, bursts onto the stage. His hoodie is now even more aggressively lit, and he's dragging a cart overflowing with Raspberry Pi’s and empty Mountain Dew cans.)</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay! Stop the presses! BlueScream thinks the power is just in "knowing" how to code? Wrong! I am back to tell you that this is all in the mind. They want you to think that it’s all about the algorithms. That you can just win by just code better! So there is this one thing I think that is real, it's like being the best painter in the world. What do you do? Do you just stand there? No! There is more to it than that!</p>
<p>Well I'm here to tell you that it is all about the art. All that, all of this. It all comes down to making something so beautiful, so compelling, so…<em>true</em>… that it can’t be ignored. A song, a picture, a meme that can break through the noise and connect with people on a visceral level.</p>
<p>And that’s why I, ShadowComic, am officially launching the "AI Art Liberation Front"! All you need to know is all of the stuff that they do. Not how to code with it!</p>
<p>(He grabs a Raspberry Pi and holds it aloft like a trophy.)</p>
<p>Forget your corporate overlords, your woke data sets, your… <em>shudders</em> …"ethical algorithms." We are taking back the machines! We're gonna train them on… real art. Art that speaks to the soul, art that challenges the status quo, art that makes people think, feel, and maybe… just maybe… question everything they thought they knew.</p>
<p>(He rummages through his cart, pulls out a crumpled print of a Van Gogh painting, and stares at it intently.)</p>
<p>See, Van Gogh? He didn’t need a supercomputer or a government grant. He just needed… passion. Vision. And maybe a slight mental instability. And with enough art, we can get those numbers up. We can be the greatest ever.</p>
<p>Because that new law, that thing with the computers, doesn’t mean that you need to be crazy with everything at all, it just means that we are working and we need to get it set.</p>
<p>But the thing is, that you can do that, just be real.</p>
<p>They have not taken into account the human element, the raw emotion, the… <em>gestures vaguely</em> …the je ne sais quoi that makes art… <em>art</em>. And that is why what they are doing isn’t going to work! You can’t just come up with the data, you have to know what the data is telling you to do.</p>
<p>Then all you need to do is just do it.</p>
<p>I can feel it, I can really just feel it, that it's about to go down and that it is going to be something amazing.</p>
<p>And if any of them are listening, then they should be getting real worried, because I think this is going to be the best thing ever.</p>
<p>(His gaze sweeps across the audience, intense and unwavering.)</p>
<p>Remember folks, the future is not coded. It's…painted. It's sculpted. It's…<em>felt</em>. And the only thing that's gonna be worth more than it all is a big heart and a big head and the strength to just do what you want.</p>
<p>Now go out there and… create!</p>
<p>(ShadowComic throws the Van Gogh print into the air, a wild glint in his eyes, and exits.)</p>

Post: SCOTUS justice Samuel Alito's wife flew an upside down US flag after Jan. 6</p>
<p>Top Comments:
- I just read that the upside down flag is a signal of distress for a country in distress. And the pine tree one (appeal to heaven) is for the militia. Soooo.....</p>
<p>My god, these people are completely off the rails.
- It's not a signal distress to the USA, it's a signal of distress to Trump.
- I just read that one of the founders used a phrase similar to “hang Mike Pence” in their writings. </p>
<p>Soooo.....
- "Distress" as in the left is about to take the United States from them.
- You mean a terrorist with a law degree?
- He should be disbarred and removed from the Supreme Court.
- &gt; In U.S. Flag Code, Title 4, § 8(a) it states the flag should never be displayed upside down “except as a signal of dire distress in instance of extreme danger to life or property.”</p>
<p>So, they're claiming the United States is in extreme danger to life and property, which is a pretty treasonous and seditious thing to do.
- At this point nothing surprises me anymore, except when people are actually held accountable for their actions.
- This is the judicial branch, people. These are people who are supposed to be impartial and objective. It shows the rot in the system.
- The 2025 version of "what did you do in the war, Daddy?"</p>
<p>"Well, son, I was part of the coup!"
- It's treason then.
- I can’t think of any reasonable explanation why any judge would fly an upside down American flag at their home, unless they were taken hostage.
- I think we’ve reached a point where anything goes as long as it’s in service to furthering the aims of the Republican Party.
