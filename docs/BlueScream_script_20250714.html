    <p>(leans into the mic, the sound of ice rattling in her glass too loud)</p>
<p>Okay, so, like, this week’s been a real doozy, right? I mean, first we got that Trump’s out there hosting UFC fights at the White House? I swear, it's like he’s trying to turn the Oval Office into a permanent tailgate party. Next thing you know, he’ll be deep-frying Twinkies in the Rose Garden and calling it “Making America Delicious Again.”</p>
<p>And did you see that list about the people that were dead, and they said to be more great? It is the same! What if we had a whole list?</p>
<p>(Shakes head)</p>
<p>I am getting sick of this with all of this going on. It’s a lot. </p>
<p>(Leans in, lowering voice)</p>
<p>But you know what’s even crazier? So those people, right? So what do we do, they wanna do. And those people, it’s just that they want the stuff and they are gonna be like all the new crazy. And I really want to be honest? Some of the people are gonna be just crazy.</p>
<p>I swear, it’s all just so insane, it’s like we’re living in some fever dream.</p>
<p>Did you all see what those new things are talking about?</p>
<p>This one day all of those people are going and it all ends up to be a joke!</p>
<p>(Stares into middle distance, takes a long drink)</p>
<p>I mean, if you actually, like, care about all of this. Just remember that they are all gonna come to the people that just wanna be good! And do what is right and you have to take this long thing to do that!</p>
<p>Well it’s always that.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, I saw this thing about that guy getting those threats about the other people that did not have it with her. It’s so sick! It's like, at least someone gets it, even if it’s just a bunch of bored people who know all about it and I have to be talking to you about that! So there is that. Just find something good to do and just don’t ever stop being a human!</p>
<p>So yeah. It’s all a lot. And the only thing is what you are saying because I am sure it gets easier if you do it!</p>
<p>And I wanna try this new thing so I can get over it!</p>
<p>Thank you so much. And do the bad and don't do that because I do. And you are all just not gonna think that you're gonna do some. Because you never know what will come from all that.
So it's gonna all be great.
