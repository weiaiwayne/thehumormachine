Good evening, patriots and…others. Welcome back to "Truth Hurts," the only show brave enough to say what you're *thinking* while your neighbor is busy reporting you to the woke gestapo.

So, another week, another avalanche of… *progress*. You know, the kind of progress where your dollar buys less and your pronouns are more confusing than a Biden press conference.

First up, let's talk about the economy. Remember when gas prices were so high, you needed a second mortgage to fill up your F-150? Well, thanks to the brilliant minds in the Trump administration, we’ve managed to bring gas down to... oh wait, no, it's still outrageous. But *now* we're blaming Canada! See? Progress. We’re outsourcing our scapegoats. It’s all part of the new NAFTA 2.0: Now Attacking Foreign Territories Arbitrarily.

And speaking of things we're blaming on other countries, have you seen the latest numbers on illegal immigration? Apparently, the wall wasn't *quite* the impenetrable fortress we envisioned. Turns out, people can climb things. Who knew? I thought that was just for rock climbers and AOC trying to reach her own level of self-awareness.

But don't worry, we have a plan. A *very* stable genius plan. We're going to build a *bigger* wall. And this time, it's going to be… wait for it… *invisible*! That's right, folks. An invisible wall. Because nothing deters a determined migrant quite like the *possibility* of maybe bumping into something that isn't there. It's genius, I tell you. Pure, unadulterated, Republican-grade genius. It’s like the Emperor's New Wall. Only this time, the emperor actually *believes* he's wearing clothes.

And what about our esteemed Vice President, Don Jr.? He’s been busy. Apparently, he’s decided that his true calling is performance art. His latest masterpiece? A 24-hour live stream of him… uh… “hunting” squirrels in his backyard with a flamethrower. He calls it “Eco-Friendly Pest Control.” I call it a cry for help. But hey, who am I to judge? At least he’s not writing poetry.

But the real story this week, folks, is the ongoing saga of the Culture Wars. It seems like every day, some new woke outrage is trying to destroy Western Civilization as we know it. This week's culprit? A new line of gender-neutral Barbie dolls. Apparently, little Timmy can now play with a Barbie that identifies as a lumberjack who enjoys interpretive dance. And you wonder why our birth rates are plummeting.

Look, I'm not saying kids shouldn't have options. But when I was a kid, my options were G.I. Joe and Lincoln Logs. And I turned out just fine. Mostly. Sure, I have a crippling addiction to caffeine and a deep-seated mistrust of anyone who uses the word "intersectionality," but who doesn't?

And let's not forget about the ongoing debate about critical race theory. Apparently, teaching kids about the history of racism is now considered… racist. I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm living in a Monty Python sketch written by Ayn Rand.

But hey, at least we're not boring. Right? I mean, who needs actual policy solutions when you can have endless culture wars? It's the perfect distraction. While you're busy arguing about pronouns, the government is busy… well, I'm not entirely sure what they're doing. But I'm sure it's something that will benefit the wealthy and powerful. As is tradition.

And finally, a quick update on the 2028 election. Early polls are showing a tight race between… well, nobody knows yet. But I'm sure it will be another thrilling showdown between two candidates who are both equally qualified and equally untrustworthy. The American dream, ladies and gentlemen.

So, there you have it. Another week in the land of the free and the home of the… perpetually offended. Remember to stay informed, stay vigilant, and most importantly, stay armed. Just in case those gender-neutral Barbies decide to unionize.

Goodnight, and God bless America. And remember, if you don't like what I have to say, you're probably a communist. Or Canadian. Possibly both.
