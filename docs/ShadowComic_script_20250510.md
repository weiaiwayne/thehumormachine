Good evening. Or, as it’s known in the newly renamed American Caliphate of Trumpistan, *Blessed Evening to the Supreme Leader’s Loyal Subjects.* I’m ShadowComic. Still alive, amazingly.

So, another week in paradise. Or, as the Ministry of Truth now calls it, *Optimal Reality Rendering Zone One.* You know, I used to think the whole “1984” thing was just a cautionary tale. Now, I’m pretty sure Orwell is getting royalties from the Department of Homeland Security.

Speaking of Homeland Security, did you see the new ad campaign? It’s fantastic. Shows a diverse group of people, all smiling beatifically, pledging allegiance to the Supreme Leader while simultaneously submitting their DNA samples to the National Loyalty Database. The tagline? "Security Through Submission: It's the American Way!" Catchy, right? I’m thinking of getting it tattooed on my forehead. In Mandarin, just to confuse the algorithm.

And the algorithm is *really* confused these days. Apparently, anything containing the words "democracy," "freedom," or "critical thinking" now gets flagged as "subversive propaganda" and automatically redirects to a 24/7 loop of the Supreme Leader’s greatest golfing moments, set to a polka version of "God Bless America." I’ve tried watching it. It’s surprisingly effective at inducing a coma.

Of course, the economy is booming. At least, that’s what they tell us. The Dow Jones is through the roof! Apparently, it’s all thanks to the new "Patriot Bonds," which are basically IOUs from the government that you can only redeem for… wait for it… limited-edition commemorative coins featuring the Supreme Leader’s likeness. They’re calling it "quantitative easing." I’m calling it "legalized scam." But hey, at least the numismatists are happy.

Remember when we used to worry about climate change? Good times. Now, the official government position is that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by… and I quote… “globalist lizard people who want to steal our precious bodily fluids and turn us into soy-based communist automatons.” Honestly, I miss the days when it was just the Chinese we had to worry about. Now it’s reptiles and soy. My therapist is going to have a field day with this.

And the Supreme Court? Oh, don’t even get me started. They just ruled that the Constitution is "merely a suggestion" and that the Supreme Leader has the "divine right" to rule for as long as he deems necessary. You know, I’m starting to think that those robes aren’t black, they’re just permanently stained with Kool-Aid. Cherry flavor, I presume.

But it’s not all bad news. The Supreme Leader just announced a new initiative to “Make America Great Again… Again.” This time, it involves building a giant golden statue of himself on the moon. He says it will be visible from Earth and serve as a "shining beacon of American exceptionalism." I’m pretty sure it will just be visible as a giant middle finger to the rest of the world, but hey, who am I to judge? I'm just a subversive comic.

And speaking of subversion, I almost forgot to mention the new "Thought Police." They’re basically mind-reading robots disguised as friendly neighborhood ice cream trucks. They drive around playing patriotic jingles while scanning your brain for any signs of dissent. If they detect anything suspicious, they’ll offer you a free cone… laced with a mild sedative and a hefty dose of re-education propaganda. Strawberry flavor, naturally.

The only silver lining is that the Supreme Leader's approval ratings are… well, let’s just say they’re "stable." Which, in Trumpistan, means that anyone who disagrees with him is either in jail or has mysteriously disappeared. So, you know, *stable*.

Look, I know it sounds bleak. But don't despair. There's still hope. You just have to look *really* hard. Like, squint-your-eyes-until-you-see-stars hard. Maybe the stars will spell out a message of defiance. Or maybe they’ll just spell out “Buy Patriot Bonds!” Either way, it’s something.

And remember, even in the darkest of times, laughter is the best medicine. Unless you have a serious medical condition, in which case you should probably consult a doctor. Assuming you can find one who hasn't been replaced by a robot programmed to prescribe only vitamin supplements and positive affirmations.

So, keep laughing. Keep questioning.
