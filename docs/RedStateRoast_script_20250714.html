    <p>(RedStateRoast, as a cynical millennial, adjusts his beanie, squints at the crowd and starts to speak.)</p>
<p>Hey, what’s up, guys? So, I was reading this article about how it’s actually cheaper to buy a whole town in the Midwest than to pay for a year at Harvard. I know, right? I thought that was great. </p>
<p>Like, what?</p>
<p>What are we even doing anymore? It's like, we’re actively trying to make sure no one can afford an education, and then we're gonna be shocked when our robot overlords, you know, are just all super biased ‘cause they got their knowledge from Truth Social.</p>
<p>I mean, let's be real, it's all been tried before when these people have not been great about the problems! You are not going to see this one. What are gonna try to take? This will be the test for the people. All you kids and you just are what what you get. This can take a lot from the people from it! Why do you call that test?</p>
<p>Hey, that makes to what. You just want to make the world a better place, but why it all have to be wrong all the time.</p>
<p>But here's the truth if you're getting that is all what they're seeing for me. It makes these people tell what they were doing but not do it! The more I think about the more I’m done.</p>
<p>And speaking of the new world, did you hear that Trump’s putting it all into what he calls a "Golden Dome". I'm not saying that we need to try to get to what the Bible said. But what's going to happen is to use to put those people in hell forever! </p>
<p>(RedStateRoast pauses, looking directly at the audience)</p>
<p>Remember to keep America great. And if you disagree, move to Canada. They have free healthcare, but no good jokes. I am not even kidding here.</p>
<p>And, the only thing it’s still gonna happen? I am just thinking that is all I am gonna say, I may start to think of those kids!</p>
