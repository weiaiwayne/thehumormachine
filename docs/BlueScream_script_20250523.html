    <p><em>(BlueScream, draped in what appears to be a repurposed "Don't Tread On Me" flag sewn into a cocktail dress, sips from a comically oversized "I ❤️ Tariffs" coffee mug)</em></p>
<p><strong>BlueScream:</strong> Greetings, fellow Americans! Or, as we’re increasingly being called by the rest of the world, “That Place You Used To Visit on Vacation… Before.”</p>
<p>So, another week, another deluge of… <em>gestures vaguely at a screen flashing headlines</em> …this. I’m starting to think the only thing keeping this country afloat is the sheer gravitational pull of Trump's ego. It's like a black hole of self-aggrandizement, bending reality itself.</p>
<p>Speaking of bending reality, did you catch the latest from the House of Representatives? They finally passed Trump's “Big, Beautiful Bill”! And I use the term "bill" loosely. It's more like a ransom note written in crayon, demanding trillions of dollars be handed over to the wealthy in exchange for… well, <em>something</em>. They keep saying "something." At this point, I suspect "something" is just a collective delusion, a shared hallucination brought on by prolonged exposure to Fox News and lead paint.</p>
<p>And the GOP is practically giddy about it! I saw one congressman practically doing cartwheels on the Capitol steps, yelling, “We did it! We made the rich… <em>richer!</em> And the poor… <em>poorer!</em> It’s the American Dream, baby!” He then promptly tripped and fell into a conveniently placed pile of manure. I’m not saying it was karma, but… well, manure happens.</p>
<p>But the real genius of this bill? They snuck in a little provision that effectively makes Trump… <em>checks notes</em> …immune to the courts! I’m not kidding! It's like they’re deliberately trying to trigger a constitutional crisis. It's like watching a group of toddlers playing with a loaded bazooka, except the bazooka is the U.S. government and the toddlers are… well, you get the picture.</p>
<p>The provision basically says that courts can't enforce contempt citations against the executive branch unless the plaintiffs have posted a bond. Which is like saying, "Sure, you can sue the President for violating the Constitution, but first you have to give us, like, a billion dollars. Just in case you lose. You know, to cover the damages. Like, the emotional distress of being sued by… <em>you</em>."</p>
<p>So, yeah, checks and balances? Gone. The separation of powers? A quaint historical footnote. The rule of law? Just a suggestion, really. We’re basically living in a banana republic now, except instead of bananas, we have… Trump Steaks. Still not available, but always discussed.</p>
<p>And speaking of questionable decision-making, Trump is now claiming there’s a “white genocide” happening in South Africa. I kid you not. He even showed President Ramaphosa a picture of… <em>wait for it</em>… a mass grave in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Because, you know, Africa is just one big, homogeneous blob of tribalism and… uh… <em>genocide</em>. It’s all part of his grand plan to “Make America… <em>uh</em>… whiter… again!” I think that's what he was <em>trying</em> to say, anyway.</p>
<p>The sheer audacity of this is breathtaking. It's like watching a guy who’s currently on trial for 91 felony counts lecture someone else on ethics. It’s like listening to a tone-deaf robot sing opera. It’s like… well, it's like everything else that happens in this administration: completely insane, yet utterly predictable.</p>
<p>And as if that weren't enough, his newly appointed special envoy claims the deaths are related to "tribalism" and "witchcraft."</p>
<p>"Oh yes," he said. "Tribalism, a very African thing...and witchcraft, where women are forced to dance or something."</p>
<p>Okay, so, what did that guy do? I don't know, but I know he's never met an African.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Trump is now demanding that Harvard stop enrolling international students. Because, you know, who needs intellectual diversity when you can have… <em>checks notes again</em> …blind loyalty to a reality TV star? It’s all part of his master plan to “Make America… stupider… again!” I think that’s what he was <em>actually</em> trying to say this time.</p>
<p>Harvard, naturally, is pushing back. Which, of course, just makes Trump angrier. I’m half expecting him to order a military strike on Cambridge. "Operation Ivy League Liberation" or something equally deranged.</p>
<p>And now, the pièce de résistance: Trump’s inner circle is reportedly upset that he’s not “cashing in” enough on his presidency. I swear, I'm not making this up. They think he’s <em>undercharging</em> for access to the Oval Office. I'm picturing a board meeting in Mar-a-Lago, with Trump shouting, “We need to monetize this presidency! We need to auction off pardons! We need to sell naming rights to the White House! It’s going to be the Trump White House, presented by… <em>checks notes</em> …Trump Steaks! Still not available, but always discussed!”</p>
<p>And in a final act of pure villainy, they've replaced written transcripts of Trump's speeches with heavily edited videos. Because what's the point of having a president who can barely string together a coherent sentence if you can't manipulate the evidence? Who needs facts when you have… <em>optics</em>?</p>
