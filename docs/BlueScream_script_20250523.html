    <p><strong>(Opening music fades, BlueScream strides confidently onto stage, a mischievous glint in her eye. A screen behind her flickers with images: Trump golfing, Kristi Noem awkwardly posing, a headline about "TrumpCoin" soaring.)</strong></p>
<p>BlueScream: Alright, folks, welcome back to "This Is My Nightmare," the show where we sift through the dumpster fire of American politics with a hazmat suit and a healthy dose of cynicism.</p>
<p>So, this week? Well, it’s like watching a toddler play with power tools: messy, dangerous, and you’re pretty sure someone’s going to lose an eye.</p>
<p>(Gestures to screen showing Trump golfing)</p>
<p>First up, Trump’s still at it, holding galas for memecoin investors at his golf course. You know, I always thought the “YMCA” was a coded message from the Village People. Turns out, it’s just a siren song luring crypto bros to the promised land of Mar-a-Lago. I mean, a helicopter, halibut, and ‘Y.M.C.A.’? It sounds like a rejected James Bond film. "From Russia With Memes."</p>
<p>(Screen shows Kristi Noem)</p>
<p>And speaking of questionable choices, Kristi Noem, bless her heart, she’s out there trying to prove she’s ready to be Trump’s running mate, even if it means she needs to shoot the dog. I think they should make that a requirement for VP now. Gotta show your loyalty to the alpha. Makes Biden look like Doctor Doolittle.</p>
<p>(Beat. BlueScream leans closer to the mic)</p>
<p>But the <em>real</em> news this week? It’s the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Because, subtlety? Never heard of her. It’s got everything! Tax cuts for the ultra-rich, Medicaid cuts for the rest of us, and a special little provision that lets Trump fire anyone who says "no" to him.</p>
<p>(Screen shows the House bill)</p>
<p>It's like they're trying to pass the Enabling Act, but they're hiding it inside a bill that also funds the construction of a solid gold toilet for Trump's yacht. Because, priorities.</p>
<p>And the courts? Oh, they're <em>totally</em> on our side. Well, except when they're… not. The Supreme Court, in a move that surprised absolutely no one, ruled that Trump <em>can</em> fire agency heads appointed by Biden. Because, you know, what’s a little judicial precedent when you’re trying to Make America Great… at firing people? I mean, you can't build a great country on the backs of unemployeed, can you?</p>
<p>(BlueScream shrugs)</p>
<p>Look, it's all part of the plan, folks. Discredit the institutions, empower the Dear Leader, and then sell TrumpCoin to the masses as a solution to all their problems. It's political alchemy, turning democracy into… well, whatever this is.</p>
<p>(The screen shows a headline about Harvard barring foreign students.)</p>
<p>And don't even get me <em>started</em> on the Harvard situation. Barring international students? Because apparently, the greatest threat to America is… knowledge. I mean, who needs brilliant minds from around the world when we have…well, never mind. Look, Trump's just making sure Harvard doesn't get any <em>more</em> liberal. And the best way to do that? Cut off their funding. What a great way to "fight the woke mob." It’s like saying "I'll show those French chefs by burning down all the bakeries!"</p>
<p>(BlueScream pauses, taking a breath.)</p>
<p>But you know what <em>really</em> boils my blood? These constant references to what are effectively concentration camps. What is <em>wrong</em> with these people!? The rhetoric is getting so scary, it makes me want to buy a bunker. Or move to Canada. But then I remember that even <em>Canada</em> has its problems. That's when I realized: the bunker is not a bad idea.</p>
<p>(She shakes her head.)</p>
<p>So, what's the takeaway, folks? We're living in a world where a former reality TV star is running the country like a bankrupt casino, the courts are playing hopscotch with the Constitution, and the only thing keeping us from total despair is… well, you tell me. Maybe it's the hope that one day, <em>something</em> will break through.</p>
<p>(BlueScream smiles wryly.)</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just the knowledge that at least <em>we</em> aren't the ones paying a million dollars for a halibut dinner.</p>
<p>(BlueScream winks, the music swells. Fade to black.)</p>
