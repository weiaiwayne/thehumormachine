**RedStateRoast:** Well, folks, another week, another dumpster fire fueled by the tears of liberals. I swear, you could power a small city with their collective meltdown. It’s practically renewable energy at this point.

First up, let’s talk about the economy. Bidenomics, remember that gem? It was supposed to be this revolutionary, equitable system. Turns out, “equitable” just means equally broke. Now, under President Trump’s triumphant return, we're seeing real growth. People are actually working, not just “content creating” from their parents' basement. They’re building things, fixing things, complaining about traffic on the way to *doing* things. It’s almost…patriotic.

And speaking of patriotic, remember that whole woke military thing? All that sensitivity training and pronouns in email signatures? Yeah, that’s gone. Now, our troops are back to focusing on what they do best: protecting our borders and occasionally liberating oil fields. It's a simple formula, really. Strength, not weakness. And lots and lots of oil.

But the snowflakes are still out there, bless their hearts. They’re clutching their participation trophies and whining about…checks notes… the *lack of vegan options* at military bases. Seriously? I’m pretty sure "toughness" isn't on the menu at the salad bar. These are the same people who think a strongly worded tweet is equivalent to storming Normandy.

Now, let’s move on to the Supreme Court. Ah, the Supreme Court. The last bastion of sanity in this increasingly insane world. They’re doing God’s work, dismantling the radical left’s agenda, one unconstitutional law at a time. And the left? They're threatening to pack the court. Again. Because apparently, if you don’t like the rules, you just change them. It’s the same logic they use to justify their genders.

But my personal favorite outrage of the week comes from the ongoing saga of… (RedStateRoast pauses for dramatic effect) …the “Gender-Affirming Care is Healthcare” Act. Yes, folks, the Democrats are still pushing to surgically alter children in the name of inclusivity. You know, because nothing says “empowerment” like irreversible bodily mutilation. And if you disagree, you’re a bigot. It’s a foolproof strategy. I bet the Romans would have conquered more if they'd just called their enemies "phobic."

And don't even get me started on the new "Equity Czar." Apparently, we need a government official dedicated solely to ensuring everyone is equally miserable. Her first initiative? A nationwide wealth redistribution program. You know, because rewarding success is so…problematic. She’s also proposing a tax on white guilt. I’m not kidding. Apparently, feeling bad about your ancestors is now a taxable offense. I'm going to be rich.

But the best part? The Equity Czar is a white, upper-class woman from Martha’s Vineyard. The irony is so thick, you could spread it on toast.

And speaking of thick…the media. Oh, the media. They’re still trying to convince us that Trump is a Russian asset, even though he’s been president twice. At this point, I think Putin is more likely to be working for Trump. He’s probably hiding in Mar-a-Lago, wearing a MAGA hat and binge-watching Fox News.

But hey, at least they’re consistent. Consistently wrong, that is. They’re so obsessed with finding dirt on Trump, they’d probably accuse him of stealing the Declaration of Independence if they thought it would get them clicks.

So, what’s next? Well, according to the polls, Trump is on track for a landslide victory in 2028. The left is already prepping their excuses. It’ll be Russia again, obviously. Or voter suppression. Or maybe even…gasp…that people actually agree with us.

But whatever happens, one thing is certain: the ride will be wild. So buckle up, buttercups. It’s gonna be a bumpy four years. And remember, if you can’t laugh at the absurdity of it all, you’ll probably cry. And nobody wants to see that. Especially not me.

**(RedStateRoast takes a long sip from the "I Identify as Taxpayer" mug.)**

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go. I’m meeting with my accountant. Apparently, owning a sense of humor is now considered a capital asset.
