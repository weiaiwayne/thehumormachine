    <p>(BlueScream slumps onto a stool, looking utterly defeated. She nurses a White Claw like it's the last lifeline in a zombie apocalypse)</p>
<p>Okay, so, like, can we just talk about this “big, beautiful bill” for a sec? I swear, every time I hear that phrase, I picture Trump trying to build a Lego house, and then just smashing it with a tiny, gold-plated hammer. Because that’s basically what he’s doing to the American economy, right? Slashing Medicaid, gutting environmental protections, and giving tax breaks to billionaires. It’s like he’s playing SimCity, but the only cheat code he knows is "rosebud.”</p>
<p>And get this, Senate Republicans are calling these things a “done deal." You know what else is a "done deal", my student loan debt, which will be going into effect next year and has been something I couldn't escape since 2010!</p>
<p>(Scoffs, takes a long pull on her drink)</p>
<p>And, like, if that wasn’t enough, I saw some article that was talking about these new data things that are gonna be taken up in the government for the next 20 years that are going to take all of our data, and send it to the new government. I was like, what is even the point, why are we even doing any of this anymore?!</p>
<p>And did you see what they’re gonna do with that extra money? They’re carving Trump's face into Mount Rushmore with the money, and they’re carving that stuff up for the new people.</p>
<p>I mean, it’s not even like it’s a <em>good</em> plan. There’s no way that is gonna be working out. The worst part is that all of those jobs and all of that isn’t gonna do a single thing for anyone but those people. And that is what is most bad.</p>
<p>It reminds me of this one time I got roped into joining a pyramid scheme. They promised me I’d be rich, living the high life, driving a Lambo. And what did I end up with? A garage full of overpriced leggings and a restraining order from my aunt. And also an inability to know the value of things. I went to the store the other day and saw that the price of a loaf of bread was like 15 dollars. </p>
<p>(Beat, stares blankly into the distance)</p>
<p>The worst part is that they are not even trying to fix it. So they are selling all of this and I’ve been getting emails that say things are going to be bad and not really being able to get it.</p>
<p>And it is all so that they can keep all the gold and the money and then they get to build that wall where the immigrants are in all the new problems it gets so weird!</p>
<p>But hey, at least we can all look forward to a world where we are selling all of this things and getting into the middle. It is almost impossible to even understand the code!</p>
<p>So, if all of you guys are just getting on here all the time to tell me that I am doing all of these things, I’m gonna say if there is one thing you get in this world that it might be just that you can use that to do anything, and that’s just what the world is supposed to be all about! It’s not about the money!</p>
<p>So, is there a way to look into that? Let’s say that it is all about me.
