Good evening, patriots, and welcome back to the only show brave enough to speak truth to power… or at least, truth to whatever the heck CNN is calling “power” these days. I'm RedStateRoast, and tonight, we're diving headfirst into the swirling vortex of… well, you know. It’s 2025. It's the same stuff, different day. Only now, it’s *our* day.

First up, let's talk about infrastructure. Remember when Biden promised us a "once-in-a-generation" infrastructure bill? Turns out, a generation is about two years in Democrat-speak. All we got was a bunch of bike lanes in San Francisco and a bridge to nowhere that magically ended up in Hunter Biden’s backyard. Well, President Trump heard you loud and clear. He's got a new infrastructure plan: Build the wall… again. Only this time, it’s going to be *so* big, *so* beautiful, it’ll generate its own gravitational field. Think of it as a patriotic black hole, sucking up all the illegal immigrants and leftist tears. It’s genius, really. We’re basically solving two problems with one giant, concrete middle finger to the woke mob.

And speaking of woke, have you seen what they’re doing to the military now? Apparently, "toxic masculinity" is a bigger threat than China. I saw a headline the other day: "Army to Replace Combat Boots with Birkenstocks to Promote Gender Neutrality." I’m not kidding! Okay, I’m exaggerating… slightly. But the direction we're heading, I wouldn’t be surprised. They’re probably teaching our soldiers how to knit friendship bracelets while reciting poetry by Maya Angelou. Meanwhile, the Chinese are building hypersonic missiles and we're worried about pronouns. I’m starting to think Sun Tzu wrote "The Art of War" specifically as a warning against liberal social engineering.

But let’s not dwell on the negative. There’s good news! Gas prices are down… slightly. Thanks to President Trump’s masterful negotiation skills, we’re now only paying three times what we were before Biden took office. It's progress, people! Baby steps. We're practically swimming in affordable gasoline… well, at least the guys with the lifted trucks are. The rest of us are still selling plasma to fill up the tank, but hey, at least we're contributing to the economy.

And what about the economy? Unemployment is at an all-time low… for illegal aliens. Apparently, sanctuary cities are booming. They’ve got more jobs than they know what to do with. I hear they're even offering free housing and healthcare. Meanwhile, in flyover country, we’re still waiting for our trickle-down economics to actually, you know, *trickle*. But don't worry, folks. President Trump assures us the wealth is coming. Any day now. Just gotta keep believing. It's like waiting for Godot, but with more gold plating and fewer existential crises.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: RedStateRoast, you’re being too cynical. Where’s the hope? Where’s the optimism? Well, I’ll tell you where it is: It’s locked away in a vault next to Hillary Clinton's emails and Hunter Biden's laptop. But seriously, folks, there is reason to be optimistic. We’ve got President Trump back in the White House, draining the swamp (again), making America great again (again), and tweeting his unfiltered thoughts at 3 AM (again). What’s not to love?

And let's not forget the Supreme Court. With Justice Kavanaugh now bench pressing the entire Constitution, and Justice Barrett single-handedly homeschooling the nation on conservative values, we are in good hands. They’re like the Avengers, but instead of fighting Thanos, they’re fighting critical race theory and gender studies. It's a much more important battle, if you ask me.

Finally, a quick word on the media. CNN is still fake news, MSNBC is still a communist propaganda outlet, and the New York Times is still printing articles on how to properly compost your kale. Nothing has changed. Except maybe their ratings. They’re so low, they’re practically subterranean. I heard they're thinking of rebranding as "The Underground Times."

So, there you have it
