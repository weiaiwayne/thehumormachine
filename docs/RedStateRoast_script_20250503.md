Good evening, patriots, deplorables, and the few remaining liberals who haven't fled to Canada yet. Welcome back to *The Right Side of History,* the only show brave enough to say what you're thinking... mostly because we have a heavily-armed security detail.

Let’s dive right in, shall we? Because frankly, I haven’t got all night to explain common sense to people who think gender is a buffet.

First up, the economy. Remember when Biden promised to build back better? Turns out, "better" meant building back… bankrupt. Now, thanks to the visionary leadership of President Trump, we're finally seeing some real growth. I mean, sure, inflation is still higher than Hunter Biden at a family reunion, but at least the stock market is booming. Mostly because everyone's investing in companies that make MAGA hats and commemorative Trump steaks. Which, by the way, are surprisingly delicious. Surprisingly. Don't tell anyone I said that.

And speaking of things that are surprisingly delicious, have you seen the new White House menu? Gone are the days of kale smoothies and organic quinoa. We're talking freedom fries, double cheeseburgers, and enough red meat to make a vegan spontaneously combust. It’s called the “Make America Great Again… One Heart Attack at a Time” plan. Very catchy.

Now, onto the real news: the ongoing border situation. The Democrats are still crying about "humanitarian crises" and "families being separated." Listen, I’m all for families, but I’m also for borders. And walls. And maybe a moat filled with alligators. Just spitballing here. The important thing is, we’re finally getting tough on illegal immigration. They're building luxury golf courses for the detainees. Okay, maybe not luxury. But they *do* get complimentary bottled water. Progress, people, progress.

And the media? Oh, the media. They're still whining about "Trump's divisive rhetoric" and "the erosion of democracy." You know, the usual. Apparently, calling out radical socialists and globalist elites is now considered "divisive." I thought it was just being honest. But hey, what do I know? I only watch Fox News and Newsmax. It’s a perfectly balanced media diet. Like eating only steak.

Speaking of radical socialists, did you hear about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s latest proposal? She wants to give everyone a guaranteed basic income. Where's the money going to come from? Unicorn farts? Taxing the rich? Please. We all know the rich are the job creators. And if you tax them too much, they’ll just move to the Cayman Islands and create jobs there. Then where will we be? We’ll be stuck with AOC and a bunch of unemployed baristas complaining about student loan debt.

Meanwhile, the culture wars are raging on. Wokeism is running rampant. They’re cancelling Mr. Potato Head for being… what? Sexist? Racist? I can’t even keep up anymore. All I know is, I miss the good old days when a potato was just a potato. And men were men. And women were… baking the potatoes. I’m kidding, ladies! Mostly.

And don’t even get me started on the transgender bathroom debate. I swear, if I have to hear one more lecture about "gender identity" and "pronouns," I'm going to scream. Look, I’m a simple man. I believe in two genders. And two bathrooms. And if you can’t figure out which one to use, just ask yourself: Do I have a penis? If the answer is yes, go to the men's room. If the answer is no, go to the ladies' room. Problem solved. Next!

Oh, and the universities! They’re still brainwashing our kids with their liberal propaganda. Teaching them about "white privilege" and "systemic racism." As if. My ancestors came to this country with nothing but the shirts on their backs. And now I have two shirts! That’s the American dream, folks. Hard work and a good tailor.

But it’s not all doom and gloom, folks. There are still reasons to be optimistic. For example, Elon Musk is building a colony on Mars. Which means, if things get really bad here, we can just pack up and move to another planet. Preferably one without any liberals.

And the Second Amendment is still alive and well. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the NRA, we can all continue to own as many guns as we want.
