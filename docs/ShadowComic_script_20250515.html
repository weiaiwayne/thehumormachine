    <p><strong>(ShadowComic walks onstage, wearing a t-shirt that says "I'm with Stupid," with an arrow pointing upwards. He shrugs, pulls out a single sheet of paper, squints at it, then throws it on the floor.)</strong></p>
<p>Alright, alright. You know, for a while there, I thought I’d run out of material. I thought, “ShadowComic, you’ve plumbed the depths of American absurdity. There’s nothing left to satirize.” Then I woke up this morning, and I found out that Trump is now selling signed copies of his mugshot.</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>Yeah. I know. Satire <em>is</em> dead. We're just performing its autopsy.</p>
<p>The mugshot. The picture that launched a thousand conspiracy theories. The Mona Lisa of moral bankruptcy. You can now own a piece of history… for the low, low price of $99. And proceeds go towards… defending himself. Because apparently, overturning democracy is an expensive hobby. I guess when you’re fighting the Deep State, you need a really good lawyer. And maybe a gold-plated shovel to dig yourself out of the… well, you get the picture.</p>
<p>I heard he's autographing them with a Sharpie made of pure, unadulterated ego. And each one comes with a certificate of authenticity, signed by… Rudy Giuliani's liver.</p>
<p>The really beautiful thing is, people are <em>buying</em> them. They’re framing them. They’re giving them as gifts. I can just imagine Christmas morning: “Honey, I got you something special this year. It’s a symbol of our shared values: authoritarianism, grift, and a complete disregard for the rule of law. Merry Christmas!”</p>
<p>And the Democrats? Oh, they're having a field day. They’re fundraising off of it. They’re selling "Never Forget" t-shirts. They're even launching a "Mugshot of Justice" campaign, whatever that is. It’s like watching two vultures fighting over a roadkill carcass. Except the carcass is the American political system.</p>
<p>But that's not the <em>real</em> story, folks. The real story is what's happening down in Florida. Remember Governor… um… what’s his name? The guy who’s trying to out-Trump Trump? Oh yeah, DeSantis. He's been pretty quiet lately, hasn't he? Probably hiding in a swamp somewhere, plotting his revenge. Maybe he’s building his own Patriotism Re-Education Camp. I hear it’s themed around the Epcot Center. Except instead of "It's a Small World," it’s "It's a White World."</p>
<p>He’s just passed a law banning… wait for it… <em>woke</em> ice cream.</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>I’m not even kidding. Apparently, “woke” ice cream is a threat to the Sunshine State. I guess they're afraid it will melt all the… conservative values. I don’t know what constitutes "woke" ice cream, but I'm assuming it involves flavors like "Social Justice Sorbet" and "Intersectionality Iced Coffee." And maybe a sprinkle of guilt.</p>
<p>The law also mandates that all ice cream shops display a sign that says "We Support Traditional American Ice Cream Values." Which I assume means vanilla. And maybe a little bit of racism.</p>
<p>I heard Ben &amp; Jerry's are thinking of relocating to Canada. They’re afraid that their “woke” ice cream might be confiscated by the Patriot Police. Imagine that: being arrested for selling ice cream. It’s like a twisted version of <em>The Ice Cream Man Cometh</em>. Except instead of a creepy ice cream man, it’s a creepy governor.</p>
<p>And then there's RFK Jr., still somehow relevant. He’s now claiming that 5G causes… climate change.</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>I'm starting to think he's not just vaccine-skeptical. He's reality-skeptical. He probably thinks the Earth is flat, the moon landing was faked, and Elvis is still alive… working as a double agent for the CIA. And, of course, that vaccines have something to do with it all.</p>
<p>You know, I used to think the Kennedys were America's royal family. Now I realize they're just America's crazy uncle. The one you try to avoid at Thanksgiving. The one who corners you in the kitchen and starts ranting about fluoride in the water.</p>
<p>The really terrifying part is, he still has supporters. People who actually <em>believe</em> this stuff. They see the Kennedy name and they think, "Ah, a voice of reason!" Never mind the decades of misinformation he's been peddling. Never mind the fact that he sounds like he’s been huffing paint thinner.</p>
<p>I saw a poll the other day that said RFK Jr. is actually gaining traction among… millennials. Millennials! The generation that grew up with the internet! The generation that supposedly values critical thinking! What happened? Did they all get brainwashed by TikTok algorithms? Did they all fall down a QAnon rabbit hole?</p>
<p>You know, I used to have hope for the future. But now I’m pretty sure we’re doomed. We’re living in a world where a reality TV star can become president, a vaccine skeptic can run for president, and woke ice cream is a threat to national security.</p>
<p>(ShadowComic sighs heavily.)</p>
<p>I’m starting to think the only solution is to build a time machine and go back to the 1950s. Back when things were simpler. Back when the biggest threat to America was… communism.</p>
