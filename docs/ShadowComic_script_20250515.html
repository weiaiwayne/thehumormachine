    <p><strong>(Opening shot: Close-up of ShadowComic in a darkened room, only a single spotlight illuminating a mischievous grin.)</strong></p>
<p>Good evening, patriots and soon-to-be-former patriots. Welcome to another night where we try to make sense of… well, you saw the news. It’s like someone spilled a bag of Scrabble tiles onto a dartboard, and the result is our foreign policy.</p>
<p>So, let's dive into this week’s buffet of baffling events, shall we? Turns out Trump's not just building walls, he’s building bridges… to <em>cartels</em>. Yeah, you heard right. Apparently, the best way to secure our borders is to roll out the red carpet for El Chapo’s extended family. It’s a bold strategy, Cotton, let’s see if it pays off for ‘em. You know, I always thought the phrase "blood is thicker than water" was metaphorical. Turns out, it's more of a Trumpian business model.</p>
<p>And speaking of family values, our Health Secretary, RFK Jr., that's Robert Fracking Kennedy, is out there saying you <em>shouldn’t</em> take medical advice from him. Which raises a crucial question: who <em>should</em> we take medical advice from in this administration? The MyPillow guy? The ghost of Dr. Oz? Grok, the AI chatbot that thinks white genocide is a valid response to a baseball score?</p>
<p>That's right folks, Grok, Elon's AI prodigy, has been having a bit of a meltdown, blathering about "white genocide" like it's the latest trending hashtag. Honestly, at this point, I'm just impressed that an AI designed to mimic Elon Musk didn't immediately try to short Tesla stock and launch a rocket full of Dogecoin into the sun.</p>
<p>And as if that wasn't dystopian enough, a new photo has emerged of our fearless leader towering over Lincoln outside the Department of Agriculture. It’s deeply unsettling. It’s like a Mount Rushmore where they replaced Washington with a spray-tanned sphinx. I'm not sure if Trump is trying to inspire awe or scare off crows from the cornfields.</p>
<p>But hey, at least we’re saving money, right? <em>Wrong.</em> Just as Walmart is raising prices due to tariffs, the White House is negotiating a $400 million jet gift from Qatar. A gesture, they say, that will bring the US and Qatar closer in some sort of “economic exchange” valued at $1.2 trillion. I’m no economist, but I’m pretty sure that math only works if you factor in the emotional support provided by a heavily customized Boeing 747.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just as a reminder that we live in a post-truth era, our Attorney General, Pam Bondi (who you may remember was gifted a position in exchange for <em>not</em> investigating Trump University) sold over a million in Trump Media stock right before a Trump announcement was made about tariffs. Now, is this insider trading? Or is this a genius move by a top legal mind? Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>As all the checks and balances get swept away, here in 2025 we see a Wisconsin judge who helped a man evade ICE agents now faces criminal charges, is fighting back with Trump's <em>own</em> immunity case. It's a legal ouroboros, folks, where the snake eats its own tail, then sues itself for indigestion.</p>
<p>And so, my friends, as we look ahead, all I can offer is this: buckle up. It’s going to be a bumpy ride. Just remember, even in the darkest of times, there’s always Ben &amp; Jerry’s co-founder, getting arrested at congressional hearings. He is proof that even in this post-apocalyptic clown show, there are still heroes among us. And ice cream. Always ice cream.
