    <p><strong>(ShadowComic walks onstage, carrying a metal detector. He sweeps it across the stage, beeping loudly, then shakes his head.)</strong></p>
<p>Nope. Still no signs of intelligent life. Just residual traces of… well, let's not get into it.</p>
<p>So, I was just reading about the latest Republican National Convention. Apparently, the theme this year is "America: Still Sort of Great." Which is… honest, I guess. Refreshingly bleak. They’re holding it in… well, let’s just say a state where the official bird is the bald-faced lie. Attendance is expected to be…enthusiastic. As long as you define "enthusiastic" as "mandatory attendance for all registered Republicans, plus a bonus MAGA hat for anyone who brings a signed confession admitting they once voted for a Democrat."</p>
<p>The keynote speaker? You guessed it. The man who brought you such hits as "Grab 'Em By The…," "Build That Wall," and "I Alone Can Fix It." He’s expected to announce his… well, I was going to say "running mate," but let’s be honest, he’s not looking for a <em>mate</em>. He’s looking for a human shield. Someone loyal enough to take the fall for him when the Patriot Police finally come knocking. My money's on Mike Lindell. He’s already halfway to crazy town. Might as well give him a free ticket.</p>
<p>I saw a leaked copy of the speech. It's mostly the usual stuff: complaints about the "fake news media," promises to "drain the swamp" (which, ironically, he’s been actively filling with toxic sludge for the past eight years), and a vaguely threatening anecdote about a squirrel who dared to question his authority. But there’s a new twist this year. He’s now claiming that the 2020 election was stolen by… time travelers.</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>Yeah. Apparently, Deep State operatives went back in time and rigged the voting machines using… advanced quantum technology. I’m not sure how they managed to sneak the quantum technology past airport security, but I’m sure Fox News will have a detailed explanation involving Hillary Clinton’s emails and a satanic ritual.</p>
<p>The Democrats, meanwhile, are having their own convention. It’s being held in a… well, let's just say a state where the official flower is the wilting hope. The theme is "America: Maybe We Can Sort of Fix It?" Slightly more optimistic, but not by much. They’re still trying to figure out who their candidate is going to be. Right now, the frontrunners are… well, let's just say they’re all roughly the same age as the Constitution. And about as relevant.</p>
<p>I saw a proposal for a new Democratic platform: "We promise to be slightly less awful than the other guys." Which, in this political climate, is practically a revolutionary statement.</p>
<p>The big news, of course, is the ongoing investigation into… everything. They’re investigating Trump for… you know, the usual stuff: treason, obstruction of justice, crimes against humanity, improper use of hairspray. But they’re <em>also</em> investigating Biden for… well, I’m not entirely sure. Something about Hunter Biden's laptop and a conspiracy involving… windmills? I think they’re trying to connect windmills to the Deep State. Because, you know, they spin. And that’s… suspicious.</p>
<p>The Justice Department, now operating out of a converted Chuck E. Cheese, is working around the clock. I heard they’re thinking of replacing the Statue of Liberty with a giant, animatronic Chuck E. Cheese. It sings patriotic songs and dispenses legal indictments. It’s very… American.</p>
<p>And the economy? Don’t even ask. Inflation is so bad, a pack of kombucha costs more than my therapist. The stock market is in freefall, driven entirely by Trump’s mood swings. If he has a bad day on the golf course, the Dow Jones plummets. It’s like we’re all trapped in his personal economic rollercoaster. And the only way to get off is to… well, I don’t know. Probably vote for someone who doesn’t base their economic policy on the phases of the moon.</p>
<p>The administration is also cracking down on… you guessed it… “fake news.” They’ve now declared that satire is a form of terrorism. Which, as a satirist, is slightly concerning. I’m starting to think I should invest in a good lawyer. And maybe a bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>I saw a report that the Patriot Police are now using AI to detect “unpatriotic thoughts.” They’re analyzing social media posts, internet searches, and even… brainwaves. Apparently, if you think about… well, let’s just say <em>certain</em> things… you might find yourself in a Patriotism Re-Education Camp. I’m not sure how they’re measuring brainwaves, but I’m assuming it involves a giant, golden Trump brain scanner. It’s very… subtle.</p>
<p>And remember climate change? The administration has declared that it’s a conspiracy perpetrated by… radical environmentalist squirrels. Apparently, they’re hoarding all the nuts to… sabotage the economy. I’m not sure how, but I’m sure Fox News will have a detailed explanation involving George Soros and a secret cabal of eco-terrorists.</p>
<p>The scariest part is, people are starting to… adapt. They’re becoming numb to the chaos. They’re shrugging their shoulders and saying, “Well, at least we still have… freedom fries?” Or, you know, whatever passes for freedom in Trumpylvania. Probably the freedom</p>
