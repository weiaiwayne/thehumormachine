    <p><strong>(ShadowComic walks onstage, a single spotlight illuminating a mischievous grin. The backdrop is a stark white screen. He’s wearing a slightly too-tight suit, a single button straining to hold on for dear life.)</strong></p>
<p>Good evening, patriots. Or, as the Department of Re-Education now prefers, “Citizens Currently Awaiting Patriotism Calibration.” How’s everyone enjoying the new national anthem? You know, the one where “America the Beautiful” is sung entirely in the style of a dial-up modem connecting to the internet? It’s… hauntingly nostalgic.</p>
<p>(Pause for weak applause)</p>
<p>So, Trump’s back. Again. I swear, it's like trying to get rid of a timeshare in Boca Raton. You think you’ve finally unloaded it, signed all the papers, popped the champagne… then BAM! There he is, tanned, ready to complain about the pool hours, and demanding you install a gold-plated toilet.</p>
<p>And what a triumphant return. The man is practically glowing. I suspect it's not just the spray tan. I think they’re using plutonium now. Makes the rallies even more… radiant. You can practically charge your phone off the enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Speaking of enthusiasm, did you catch the victory speech? A masterclass in stream-of-consciousness rambling. He promised to drain the swamp, build a wall, make America great again… and also, apparently, to personally negotiate a trade deal with the squirrels in Central Park. I’m not even kidding. He specifically called out “those bushy-tailed negotiators.” I think he suspects they’re in cahoots with Soros.</p>
<p>And his cabinet picks? Oh, they're a tapestry of… let's call it "unconventional wisdom." Betsy DeVos is back as Secretary of Education, this time pushing for mandatory cursive instruction in <em>all</em> subjects. Apparently, it's the only way to truly understand the hidden meanings in QAnon manifestos. You know, because Comic Sans is too mainstream.</p>
<p>Then there’s the new Attorney General, Rudy Giuliani, who's been tasked with proving that voter fraud is real by… and I quote from the official memo… "interviewing every single pigeon in Philadelphia." I'm told he's using a modified Ouija board and a bag of stale pretzels as his primary interrogation tools. The results are… inconclusive. The pigeons, however, have filed a formal complaint with the ACLU, citing “unreasonable search and seizure of crumbs.”</p>
<p>I saw that Mexico's ex-governor had her tourist visa revoked. Apparently, Trump thought she looked at him funny during a G7 summit back in 2019. We’re officially using psychic grievances as grounds for international relations. I'm half expecting him to ban Canada because Justin Trudeau once wore socks with… <em>gasp</em> pandas on them. Pandas! What is this, treason?</p>
<p>And the economy? Booming, apparently. At least according to Truth Social. Everyone else is just… adapting. The new minimum wage is 14 Truth Social followers. Which, if you think about it, isn’t that different from the actual minimum wage back in 2020.</p>
<p>The news media? Well, let’s just say they’re having a tough time. The <em>New York Times</em> is now publishing in crayon. Claims it's more "authentic" and "easier for the president to understand." The <em>Associated Press</em> has been rebranded as the “Approved Press,” and their logo is now a tiny, smiling Trump head.</p>
<p>And Reddit? Oh, Reddit is… interesting. It’s been officially designated a “National Historical Archive of Pre-Patriotism Thought.” Basically, it’s a digital museum of all the wrong opinions. The comments sections are now curated by AI bots trained to respond to dissenting opinions with canned slogans and patriotic emojis. It's like arguing with a sentient flag.</p>
<p>But hey, at least we’re all united. United in our shared… bewilderment. United in our collective… resignation. United in our silent, internal screaming.</p>
<p>(ShadowComic leans into the microphone, lowering his voice)</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I wonder if this is all just a really elaborate performance art piece. Like, Sacha Baron Cohen’s greatest prank ever. The only problem is, Cohen usually reveals himself at some point. Trump? He just keeps doubling down on the crazy. Maybe we’re all just extras in a reality show that nobody signed up for. And the ratings are through the roof.</p>
<p>But hey, at least we have humor, right? Humor is the last bastion of sanity in a world gone mad. It’s the tiny, flickering candle in the face of overwhelming darkness. It's the… (He sighs) …well, it's something.</p>
<p>So, laugh. Laugh while you still can. Because who knows what tomorrow will bring? Maybe mandatory synchronized swimming lessons. Maybe a national holiday celebrating the invention of the hamburger phone. Maybe… well, let’s just say I’m not ruling out anything anymore.</p>
<p>(ShadowComic pauses, a sardonic smile playing on his lips.)</p>
<p>And if I disappear tomorrow? Well, just remember… I told you so. And maybe, just maybe, those squirrels <em>are</em> up to something.</p>
