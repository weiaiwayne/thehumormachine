    <p><strong>(ShadowComic shuffles onstage, dragging a small, battered globe behind him. He sets it down with a thud and stares at it skeptically.)</strong></p>
<p>Good evening. Or good… something. Hard to keep track of time when the news cycle moves faster than Trump's lawyers.</p>
<p>So, I just got back from a fact-finding mission. I circled the globe… digitally. Because, you know, passports are for communists and people who want to see things that aren’t gold-plated. And let me tell you, the planet is… shrinking. Not physically, of course. Although, with the polar ice caps melting as fast as Trump’s approval rating among moderate Republicans, maybe it <em>is</em> shrinking. No, it’s shrinking ideologically. It’s all becoming one giant, beige-colored… Mar-a-Lago.</p>
<p>I saw on Reddit that the Patriotism Re-Education Camps are now mandatory for anyone caught using a non-approved emoji. Apparently, the winky face is a sign of "deep state subversion." Which, I guess, makes sense. It's pretty suggestive. I can see that. I think the official emoji of the Trump administration is the grimace. Or maybe just a picture of Rudy Giuliani sweating.</p>
<p>And speaking of mandatory things, did you hear about the new "Loyalty Pledge"? Every citizen now has to recite it before ordering a coffee. It’s a real mouthful. Starts with "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of… Trumpylvania," and ends with "and may all liberal snowflakes melt in the glorious sunshine of the Trump empire." I tried ordering a latte this morning and almost choked on the word "empire." The barista just stared at me blankly. I think she’s been re-educated.</p>
<p>The big news this week, of course, is Trump's latest legal victory. He managed to convince the Supreme Court that he’s actually immune from… well, everything. Turns out, the Constitution was just a suggestion. Like pants at Mar-a-Lago. He can literally shoot someone on Fifth Avenue… again… and claim diplomatic immunity. From himself. It’s genius, really. Evil genius, but genius nonetheless.</p>
<p>And the Republicans are loving it. They’re all lining up to kiss the ring. Or, more likely, the golf shoe. I saw Senator McTurtle… you know, Mitch McConnell’s great-grandson… on Fox News yesterday, praising Trump’s “bold and decisive leadership.” I swear, he looked like he was being held hostage. He kept blinking SOS in Morse code with his eyelids. Either that, or he was just trying to stay awake. C-SPAN. It's strong stuff.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Democrats are… well, they’re still figuring out what happened in 2016. They’re holding strategy sessions in yoga studios, trying to manifest a solution. I heard they’re thinking of running Oprah again. Or maybe a hologram of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At this point, anything’s possible. Except, you know, actual meaningful change.</p>
<p>And the economy? Don’t even get me started. Inflation is so high, a loaf of bread costs more than a year's tuition at Trump University. The stock market is fluctuating wildly, based entirely on Trump’s tweets. If he tweets something positive about ham sandwiches, the ham sandwich futures go through the roof. It’s insane. I’m thinking of investing in squirrel futures. Apparently, they’re poised for a major comeback.</p>
<p>The administration is also cracking down on “fake news.” Which, apparently, includes anything that isn’t a glowing profile of Trump’s hair. They’ve shut down several major news outlets. Replaced them with state-run propaganda channels. They’re all broadcasting 24/7 footage of Trump playing golf. It’s mesmerizing. I almost forgot what reality was. Almost.</p>
<p>I saw a protest the other day. A small group of people holding signs that said “Resist.” The Patriot Police showed up and arrested them for… littering. Apparently, holding signs is now considered a form of environmental pollution. They’re replacing the signs with government-approved posters that say “Obey” and “Enjoy Your Complacency.” It’s very… Orwellian. With a touch of spray tan.</p>
<p>And remember climate change? The administration has solved it! They’ve declared that it doesn’t exist. Problem solved. They’re now focusing on more pressing issues, like… building a giant golden statue of Trump on the moon. Apparently, it’s a “tribute to American exceptionalism.” I’m sure the aliens are thrilled.</p>
<p>The scariest part is, people are starting to accept it. They’re becoming desensitized to the madness. They’re shrugging their shoulders and saying, “Well, at least the trains are running on time.” Or, you know, whatever passes for trains in Trumpylvania. Probably golf carts.</p>
<p>I’m starting to feel like I’m living in a dystopian novel. Except the author is a reality TV producer with a severe personality disorder. And the ending… well, the ending is still being written. But it’s not looking good.</p>
<p><strong>(ShadowComic kicks the globe, sending it spinning wildly.)</strong></p>
<p>I’m thinking of moving to Canada. Or maybe Mars. Anywhere that isn’t… this.</p>
<p>But hey, at least the kombucha is still locally sourced. For now.</p>
<p><strong>(ShadowComic stares blankly at the audience, then slowly backs away, muttering something about needing a stronger drink.)</strong></p>
