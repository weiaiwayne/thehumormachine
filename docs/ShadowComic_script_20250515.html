    <p><strong>(ShadowComic saunters onstage, wearing a tinfoil hat slightly askew. He gestures dismissively at it.)</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry, it's not for <em>me</em>. It's to protect the mic. Can't be too careful these days. The 5G's got a mind of its own. RFK Jr. told me himself. Just after the dolphin autopsy.</p>
<p>(Pauses, adjusting his tie)</p>
<p>So, I’ve been following the news. Which, at this point, is less "news" and more "performance art by sociopaths." And let me tell you, the reviews are… mixed.</p>
<p>First off, Pakistan. Balochistan declaring independence? What is it with nations lately? Everyone's pulling a Brexit. I fully expect Texas to declare independence by next Tuesday. They’ll probably rename it "Greater Trumpylvania" and immediately start deporting Californians. The flag will be a giant cowboy boot crushing a avocado.</p>
<p>But the real head-scratcher this week is the decapitated dolphin. A federal crime, apparently. Twenty grand reward. I'm picturing some grizzled, seen-it-all marine biologist, muttering, "Twenty grand… that's not even enough for the therapy I'm gonna need after this."</p>
<p>And of course, Reddit. Bless their hearts. They immediately jumped to the obvious conclusion: RFK Jr. Did it. With his bare hands. While swimming in raw sewage.</p>
<p>(Leans into the mic conspiratorially)</p>
<p>Look, I’m not saying he <em>did</em> it. I’m just saying… has anyone checked his minivan? I mean, the guy thinks vaccines cause autism. A decapitated dolphin is practically a logical next step. It's like going from amateur hour to a performance at the Kennedy Center. The raw sewage is a nice touch, though. Really ties the whole thing together. Method acting, you know?</p>
<p>And then there’s the rumor that Trump… well, let's just say he had a <em>close encounter</em> of the third kind with the deceased cetacean. I’m not even going to touch that one. Some things are too sacred to satirize. And by "sacred," I mean "too disturbing to even contemplate without requiring a month of intensive therapy and a lifetime supply of brain bleach." But the fact that people <em>believe</em> this… that's the real punchline.</p>
<p>Speaking of punchlines, UnitedHealth is under criminal investigation for Medicare fraud. Medicare fraud! The one thing that unites Republicans and Democrats: ripping off the elderly. It’s like the one bipartisan initiative left in this country.</p>
<p>They're sending unsolicited Cologuard tests to people. Six or seven times. I’m picturing some poor, elderly woman, drowning in a sea of cardboard boxes filled with colorectal cancer screening kits. She probably thinks it’s a sign from God. Or maybe just a very aggressive marketing campaign. Either way, she's probably going to end up with a colonoscopy whether she wants one or not. It's like a forced enema of capitalism.</p>
<p>They'll get a slap on the wrist, of course. A measly fine. A sternly worded letter from a senator who's probably invested in UnitedHealth. And then they’ll lay off a few thousand employees to make up for the loss. It’s the circle of life. Except instead of lions and gazelles, it’s CEOs and unemployed healthcare workers.</p>
<p>But here’s the real genius move: buy some Trump crypto, and the probe magically disappears. It’s like a reverse money laundering scheme. You start with dirty money, run it through the Trump grift machine, and it comes out smelling like… well, still dirty money, but at least it's <em>patriotic</em> dirty money.</p>
<p>And finally, Boy Hits Car. The band, not an actual crime. Although, in some neighborhoods, the former might be considered the latter. Their concert was canceled because a truck hit the venue. The Whisky A Go Go, no less. It’s like a Spinal Tap outtake written by Franz Kafka.</p>
<p>The headlines are pure poetry: "Truck Hits Whisky A Go Go; Boy Hits Car Show A No-Go." I mean, come on. You can’t make this stuff up. Unless you’re a satirist, in which case, you can. And I just did.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think the universe has a sense of humor. A dark, twisted, incredibly cynical sense of humor. It’s like we’re all characters in a cosmic sitcom, written by a committee of nihilistic chimpanzees. And the punchline?</p>
<p>(Looks directly into the camera with a weary smile)</p>
<p>We’re it.
