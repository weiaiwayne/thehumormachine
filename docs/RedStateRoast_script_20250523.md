**(RedStateRoast swaggers onto the stage, sporting a "Keep Calm and Deport Them All" t-shirt and a suspiciously orange tan. He grabs the mic, adjusting it to an aggressive angle.)**

Evening, patriots! Or, as they say in Silicon Valley, “Good morning, future overlords!”

**(Beat for awkward laughter)**

Folks, it’s Friday. And you know what that means? Time to celebrate the slow, agonizing death of the American Dream! Brought to you tonight by Freedom Eagle Energy Drinks. Because freedom ain’t free, but high fructose corn syrup is!

So, what's been cooking in the swamp?

Well, our beloved President, Donald J. Trump, fresh off his Nobel Peace Prize nomination for… uh… successfully negotiating the location of the next Miss Universe pageant…

**(RedStateRoast coughs awkwardly)**

…has been a busy bee.

First, he stormed Capitol Hill, personally lobbying Republican lawmakers. Apparently, threatening to primary them with a rabid chihuahua wasn't enough. Now he's offering them signed copies of "The Art of the Deal" – autographed in gold Sharpie, naturally. Though, knowing Trump, it's probably just Mike Pence in a Trump mask holding a Sharpie.

The result? The House passed the "Big, Beautiful Bill." Or as I like to call it, the "Trickle-Up Economics Bonanza!" It’s got tax cuts for the wealthy (because, let’s be honest, they’re just *not* suffering enough), and Medicaid cuts for the poor (because, you know, bootstraps!). They even slipped in tax breaks for gun silencers. Because what says "family values" like making it easier to commit a crime without disturbing the neighbors? Think of it as a “Second Amendment Stimulus Package.”

And to ensure the courts don’t get any fancy ideas about stopping this glorious redistribution of wealth, they tucked in a little provision that essentially renders the Supreme Court about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Can’t enforce contempt citations? What's next, not being able to order lunch? This is how liberty dies: with polite applause and a footnote in a budget bill.

The Left, of course, is losing their minds. “Fascism!” they cry. “Tyranny!” Oh, please. It’s just… *efficient* government. Think of it as streamlining the process of turning America into a libertarian paradise, where the only laws are against public urination and not owning a gun.

Speaking of unhinged lefties... Harvard. Oh, Harvard. Apparently, Trump has barred them from enrolling international students. Now, I know what you’re thinking: “But RedStateRoast, aren’t you all about ‘America First’?” Well, yes. But that doesn't mean letting a bunch of commie pinkos from Europe and China come here and… learn things! We need to protect our precious American ignorance from foreign contamination.

Plus, apparently, Harvard has a "Chinese Communist Party coordination problem." Which I assume means they’re serving kung pao chicken in the cafeteria.

And in a move that will surely go down in history, Trump has decided to replace all written transcripts of his remarks with… videos! Because, you know, who needs to *read* when you can just *watch*? It's the dawn of a new era of oratory! Where coherence is optional and autotune is mandatory.

**(RedStateRoast pulls out a small, gilded microphone and warbles a few garbled notes.)**

“China! Bad! Make America… great… again! Covfefe!”

**(He stops, shrugging.)**

See? Just as informative as the real thing!

And the cherry on top of this dumpster fire of a news cycle? Turns out the new head of Social Security, hired straight from Wall Street, had to Google what the job even *was*. Folks, I am not kidding!

**(RedStateRoast stares blankly at the audience for a moment.)**

I... I got nothing. You can’t satirize reality when reality is already a self-parody.

**(RedStateRoast sighs, shaking his head.)**

You know what? I need a drink. And maybe a citizenship in Greenland.

**(He raises his giant Trump-branded soda cup.)**

To America! May we all live long enough to see it declared a historical reenactment.

**(RedStateRoast exits, muttering about the "woke mind virus" and the rising price of gasoline.)**
