(RedStateRoast strides onto the stage, adjusting his MAGA hat. The backdrop is a poorly photoshopped image of Mount Rushmore with Trump's face replacing Lincoln's. A single spotlight illuminates him.)

RedStateRoast: Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in. Or, as Biden would say, “Look what… uh… where are we?” Folks, I’m RedStateRoast, and tonight, we’re diving into the swamp so deep, even the alligators are wearing waders.

First up, the House passed Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill." Now, you might think a bill with that name would include, I don't know, actual beauty? Maybe a clause mandating that AOC get a makeover? Sadly, no. It's mostly just tax cuts for billionaires and Medicaid reductions for… well, everyone else. It’s like a reverse Robin Hood, except instead of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, we're stealing healthcare from the poor to buy Trump another golden toilet.

And speaking of gold, this bill is so bad, even Lindsey Graham is saying, "Hold on, y'all, maybe we’re being a *little* too generous to the one percent." Lindsey Graham! That's like Satan saying, "Maybe we should dial down the eternal damnation a notch." You know things are dire when *he’s* the voice of reason.

But the bill’s a lock to pass because nothing unites Republicans like screwing over the little guy, except maybe a photo op with a bald eagle. Or a chance to impeach Hillary… again.

Then there's the small matter of Trump wanting to run the country like it's his own personal fiefdom. He wants to fire the heads of independent agencies whenever he feels like it. Now, normally, I'd be all for firing government bureaucrats – especially the ones who keep telling me my carbon footprint is too big. But these are *independent* agencies. They're supposed to be immune to Trump's whims. But not according to our Supremes.

Apparently, Trump can fire anyone he wants, anytime he wants, because in America, the President is King! King… of Bankruptcy, maybe.

But the *real* winner of the week is Harvard. Trump tried to ban foreign students from attending, because apparently, smart people from other countries are a threat to… something. I don't know, maybe he thinks they'll teach Barron trigonometry.

Harvard, bless their elitist hearts, immediately sued. I love it, the elites fight the elites. You know, it's hard to pick who to root for when you are a populist. It's like watching two yachts collide. Who cares, just grab the caviar and watch it burn.

And a judge, in a stunning display of… doing their job, blocked the ban. So, congratulations, Harvard, you can continue to groom future globalist overlords. Just try to keep them out of our elections this time, okay?

And you think that is all? Nah, it gets crazier.

Trump is now hosting meme coin dinners! Yep, you heard that right. If you want to dine with the President, all you have to do is buy a bunch of his crypto coins. Now, I'm not saying that's corrupt, but it’s definitely a step down from the Lincoln Bedroom. It's a little hard to imagine Abe hosting a DOGE-themed soiree, isn’t it? Also, side note, I didn’t even know Trump had a meme coin. What's next, Trump-branded NFTs? Oh, wait. Never mind.

And the kicker? The price of admission to this dinner was so high, it averaged out to a million dollars a seat! I could have bought, like, a hundred MAGA hats for that price. Or, you know, paid off my mortgage. But hey, who needs financial security when you can have a photo with the President?

The lefties, of course, are losing their minds, calling it unethical. But let's be honest, folks, Trump could sell access to his colonoscopy and his supporters would buy it if it meant owning the libs.

But, what is really messed up is that that very same week, Kristi Noem declared that Havard worked with the Chinese Communist Party. Now, I have been known to work with some unsavory types, but CCP are usually off limits. It is like an unspoken rule in Washington.

And finally, someone needs to hide his map before Trump starts trying to trade Puerto Rico for Greenland again.

(RedStateRoast takes a long pause, looking directly at the camera)

Look, folks, at least it is entertaining. Think of it like this: we're all living in a reality TV show, and the producers are clearly on crack. But hey, at least the ratings are good, right?

Goodnight, and God bless America. And may God have mercy on our souls.
(RedStateRoast tips his hat as the spotlight fades. The Mount Rushmore backdrop remains, a silent testament to the absurdity of it all.)
