    <p>(leans on the mic, the sound of ice rattling in her glass too loud)</p>
<p>Hey, so you guys see Trump nominated that Hooters-loving alpha male, Nick Adams, as ambassador to Malaysia? I swear, it’s like he’s deliberately trying to create a diplomatic incident. I’m picturing this guy showing up at some fancy embassy ball in a muscle shirt and cargo shorts, hitting on the ambassador's wife while mansplaining the finer points of…I don’t know… cryptocurrency to the Malaysian prime minister.</p>
<p>(beat)</p>
<p>And the job qualifications? I don't care. I thought they would at least be able to speak English! So just what is the point if they are not going to do it?</p>
<p>But you know what’s even more insane? The Democrats. are now getting more mad about the world! Who do they think that they are? I didn’t see them getting mad! I am doing whatever I can. I don’t want anyone to try and get on me.</p>
<p>(beat)</p>
<p>It’s like, guys, remember when we used to have standards? Like, you know, a basic understanding of international relations? A passing familiarity with the country you’re supposed to be representing? Now it's just a social contest that won't happen any time.</p>
<p>And as if this wasn’t already enough the world has now moved on. And people are just doing all those things. It doesn't even make sense!</p>
<p>(long drag from her vape)</p>
<p>You know what this all reminds me of? When I tried to convince my parents that I was a “content creator” and needed them to pay for my trip to Bali. The world is just for me to know and say that I was in the right.</p>
<p>They’re just trying to distract us from the fact that they are doing bad.</p>
<p>I'm just saying that all the time. I’m not just saying that, all that has to be okay.</p>
<p>(beat)</p>
<p>I’m thinking the only way to really make sense of this is to… well, to just embrace the absurdity.</p>
<p>I mean. I wanna say these things.</p>
<p>You know, what if there is no point of the government or of these people? I am just going to do that! </p>
<p>Because that’s all we have left here anymore with the people that have their finger on the trigger.</p>
<p>So, anyway, anyone want another drink? I'm buying. We'll need all the help we can get as we move forward.</p>
