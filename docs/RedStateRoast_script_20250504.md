Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. Or should I say, settle down, *patriotically-patterned* snowflakes, since the Department of Re-Education sensitivity training has finally kicked in. Good to see some results, frankly.

So, another week, another avalanche of leftist lunacy. You know, I swear, these people spend more time trying to virtue signal than trying to find their own car keys. And speaking of cars, have you seen the price of gas? Joe Biden’s legacy: a tank of gas costing more than a semester at Harvard…which, let’s be honest, is still cheaper than a woke gender studies degree.

But hey, at least we’re energy independent again. Thanks to President Trump’s unwavering commitment to…well, to being President Trump. The man could sell ice to Eskimos and then convince them global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Which, let’s be honest, it probably is.

And speaking of China, they’re still trying to buy up all our farmland, aren't they? It's not enough they’re flooding us with cheap plastic garbage made by child slaves. Now they want to control our food supply? I say, let them try. I’m pretty sure the average American diet consists of 70% processed chemicals and 30% freedom. Good luck weaponizing *that*, commies.

Of course, the real crisis is still the border. Remember when they called it a “manufactured crisis”? Well, now it’s manufactured alright. Manufactured by the Democrats to import future voters who will gladly trade their freedom for free stuff. It’s the Trojan Horse, people! Except instead of soldiers, it’s filled with…well, you know.

But hey, at least we have a wall now. A beautiful, big, beautiful wall. And it's working great! Sure, there are tunnels, ladders, and the occasional trebuchet, but overall, very effective. Very effective at making liberals cry, that is. Which, let’s be honest, is half the point.

And don't even get me started on the universities. They're still indoctrinating our kids with radical leftist propaganda! Teaching them about… *gasp* …history! And science! As if their feelings aren't more important than facts. But hey, at least we're fighting back. President Trump's new "Patriot Curriculum" is finally being implemented. Now our kids will learn about the *real* heroes: George Washington, Ronald Reagan, and Tucker Carlson.

Meanwhile, the woke mob is still trying to cancel everything. They came for Mr. Potato Head, they came for Dr. Seuss, and now they’re coming for… well, I’m not sure what they’re coming for next. Probably the Second Amendment. Or Christmas. Or, God forbid, both.

And speaking of God, the churches are still empty. Where is everyone on Sunday mornings? Too busy tweeting about their pronouns? Too busy protesting something? Look, I get it. Church can be boring. But it's better than listening to some self-proclaimed guru tell you how to be "mindful" while simultaneously charging you $500 for a yoga retreat.

But don’t worry, folks. There's still hope. President Trump is still fighting for us. He's still draining the swamp. He's still making America great again…again. And if you don't like it, well, you can always move to Canada. Just don't forget to take your pronouns with you.

And speaking of Canada, did you hear about their new policy requiring all maple syrup to be labeled with a warning about potential “cultural appropriation”? Apparently, the indigenous tribes of Canada invented maple syrup. Which I guess means Aunt Jemima is in real trouble.

But hey, at least we’re still free. Free to say what we want, free to believe what we want, and free to own as many guns as we want. And if anyone tries to take that away from us, well, we’ll just… well, you know.

And finally, a word about the upcoming elections. Remember to vote. Vote early, vote often, and vote Republican. Because if we don't, well, we're all doomed. Doomed to a future of socialism, open borders, and gender-neutral bathrooms. Which, let’s be honest, is a fate worse than death.

So go out there, folks, and make America great again…again. And if anyone gives you trouble, just tell them RedStateRoast sent you. They’ll
