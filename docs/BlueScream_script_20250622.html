    <p>(BlueScream, cynical millennial, nursing a White Claw at the edge of the stage, with a thousand-yard stare)</p>
<p>Okay, so, you guys seeing this? Trump actually bombed Iranian nuclear sites. Like, full-on bombs, not just sanctions and strongly worded tweets. It's like, remember when Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for <em>not</em> bombing anyone? Simpler times, am I right?</p>
<p>Now, the reason is that there is so much going on and for the last few weeks it is as if it is only getting worse.</p>
<p>And also so many people are so pissed!</p>
<p>And the right wing is going nuts because we are about to have a world war!</p>
<p>(Beat, sips White Claw)</p>
<p>And all of this is making the new and younger people scared because they are just trying to live their lives!</p>
<p>And these are our leaders and they have been doing all the stuff and it’s like what is even gonna happen?</p>
<p>But has anyone actually seen our president? Did all those military parades and that stuff really work?!</p>
<p>What I am saying is who’s in charge, really? And I don’t care enough to keep up.</p>
<p>(Leans into the mic, conspiratorially)</p>
<p>You know what my grandma told me?</p>
<p>They want all the new people to die! Just so they can have all the money!</p>
<p>I should just go to bed.</p>
<p>So, I have a plan to move the troops, and all of the people who want to make the world better, to a place where the government can't touch it.</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>Canada! I had no hope for those people but they started to take the world for things they want to do.</p>
<p>So, what do you say? You with me? Let’s sell all our crypto, buy a fleet of kayaks, and paddle north until we hit… well, something less insane.</p>
<p>(Pause, looks around, realizes she’s alone)</p>
<h2>Okay, well, I’m gonna do it anyway. Canada, here I come. Just gotta finish this White Claw first. You know, for… uh… strength.</h2>
