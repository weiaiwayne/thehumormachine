Good evening, patriots. Or, as we’re now legally obligated to call you, “Content Consumers of the American Brand.” How’s everyone enjoying their mandatory flag-waving exercises? Getting those patriotism muscles nice and toned? I know I am. I can practically salute for a full minute now without my arm cramping. Progress!

So, another week, another victory for… well, you know. The guy who likes things that are tremendous. The one who, according to his latest social media posting – which, by the way, is now officially part of the Library of Congress – has single-handedly cured the common cold. Apparently, it involves a combination of bleach, hydroxychloroquine, and positive thinking. Side effects may include a slight orange tint and an unwavering belief in the QAnon narrative, but hey, small price to pay for not sniffling, right?

And speaking of small prices, have you seen the price of freedom lately? It’s gone up! Apparently, the new Freedom Tax is essential for funding the “Operation: Make America Great… Again… Again… Again…” campaign. All proceeds go towards building a bigger, better wall. This time, it’s not just on the southern border; it’s around the entire country. Think of it as a national hug. A very expensive, concrete hug.

The administration also announced new guidelines for what constitutes “patriotic art.” Apparently, anything that doesn't feature a bald eagle, a billowing flag, or a portrait of… well, you know… is considered subversive and will be promptly removed from public display. So, say goodbye to modern art, abstract expressionism, and anything even remotely resembling nuance. Hello, endless murals of glorious leaders golfing.

And let’s talk about education. The Department of Education has officially replaced history classes with “Alternative Facts 101.” Students will now learn about the real reasons for the Civil War (spoiler alert: it wasn’t about slavery), the genius of trickle-down economics (it’s just… trickling… slowly), and the unwavering commitment to truth exemplified by… you guessed it. Bonus points if you can correctly identify the author of the quote, “Believe me.”

The good news is, critical thinking is now considered a pre-existing condition, so you’re exempt from having to use it. Saves on mental energy, right?

And the Supreme Court? Well, they’ve been busy. They just ruled that the right to bear arms now includes the right to bear arms at all times, in all places, even in your sleep. They clarified that the Second Amendment is actually about the right to bear *literal* arms. As in, prosthetic limbs. So, if you’ve always wanted a robotic arm with a built-in laser pointer, now’s your chance!

But don’t worry, they’re also working hard to protect our freedoms. Specifically, the freedom to be relentlessly surveilled. The Patriot Act 2.0, or as I like to call it, “Big Brother’s Back and He’s Got a Drone,” has been passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Now, every citizen has a personal surveillance drone following them at all times. It’s like having a tiny, buzzing friend who never leaves your side and reports your every move to the authorities. Think of it as personalized security! Or, you know, the total erosion of privacy. Potato, potahto.

The new Secretary of Silencing Dissent, formerly known as the Press Secretary, held a press conference earlier today. He – or she, I’m never quite sure these days – announced that all dissenting opinions are now considered “fake news” and will be immediately censored. The official explanation? “We’re just trying to protect the American people from… the American people.” Makes perfect sense, doesn’t it?

On a lighter note, the White House just announced its new official state snack: Cheeto dust. Apparently, it perfectly embodies the spirit of America: artificially flavored, slightly orange, and surprisingly addictive.

And finally, I’d like to remind everyone to please remain calm and continue to consume. The government assures us that everything is perfectly normal, and that any feelings of unease or existential dread are simply the result of… foreign influence. So, just ignore those feelings and keep buying those flags, folks!

**(ShadowComic pauses, a knowing look in their eyes.)**

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go. My personal surveillance drone is starting to get impatient. And I wouldn’t want to be flagged for unpatriotic behavior. After all, in these trying times, the only thing worse than being forgotten is being remembered.
