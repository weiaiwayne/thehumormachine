    <p><em>(BlueScream saunters onstage, sporting a t-shirt that reads "I Survived 130 Days of DOGE." She's carrying a bedazzled traffic cone.)</em></p>
<p>Well, hello, deplorables and debt-ridden dreamers! I’m BlueScream, still trying to figure out if “post-truth” qualifies as a pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>This week, it’s been less "Government" and more "Performance Art Project Gone Horribly Wrong." It’s like watching a toddler try to assemble IKEA furniture with a flamethrower. The instructions are on fire, the Allen wrench is missing, and the entire world is slowly filling with smoke.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Elon, shall we? He's left the building. Or, as he probably put it to Trump, "I’m strategically redeploying my assets to optimize shareholder value, while simultaneously achieving peak brand synergy with the QAnon demographic." Which, loosely translated, means "My bladder hurts too much to keep pretending I understand government."</p>
<p>He's now back to doing what he does best: Tweeting through it. Of course, Trump said he’d still be an advisor. That’s comforting. I mean, who better to advise a world leader than a guy who gets his foreign policy tips from anime forums and just got punched in the face by his kid?</p>
<p>I’m sure their brainstorming sessions are riveting. “Okay, Elon, what’s the plan for dealing with China?” “Well, Mr. President, have you considered launching a fleet of Dogecoin-powered rockets to… uh… something? Maybe colonize Mars? I don’t know, I’m just spitballing here. Also, I think my brain worms are telling me the moon landing was faked.”</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that “Make America Healthy Again” report by RFK Jr. It’s truly a masterpiece of… well… <em>something</em>. If by "Healthy" you mean "Riddled with AI-Generated Nonsense," then mission accomplished. Turns out, the new Surgeon General isn’t just spreading vaccine misinformation; he’s pioneering a new form of medical research: “Alternative Fact-Checking.” Just when I thought he couldn't get any more questionable!</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry," he said. "These studies are totally legit. I got them from a very reliable source. He also sells crystals, snake oil, and limited-edition Trump Steaks. Still not available, but… uh… <em>something</em>."</p>
<p>I mean, I know we’re living in the post-truth era, but I didn’t realize that meant we were also living in the post-citation era. Who needs peer-reviewed studies when you can have ChatGPT hallucinate a bunch of fake data to support your pre-existing biases? I’m pretty sure the only thing missing from that report was a disclaimer that read: “This document may contain traces of nuts and/or brain worms.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is doing its usual thing: diligently dismantling the remains of the social safety net while simultaneously upholding the sacred right of billionaires to… well… do whatever they want. I’m starting to think their motto is “Justice is blind… and also really, <em>really</em> good at tax avoidance.”</p>
<p>Oh, and let’s not forget that Joni Ernst, bless her heart, is now telling us that Medicaid cuts are no big deal because “we’re all going to die” anyway. Apparently, the official GOP platform is now just nihilistic resignation. “Why bother providing healthcare? We’re all just worm food in the end!” It's the kind of life-affirming message you'd expect from a motivational speaker at a mortuary.</p>
<p>And, of course, Trump is still raging about tariffs. He's now accusing China of violating some obscure trade agreement. It’s like watching a toddler accuse another toddler of stealing his Legos… while simultaneously smashing the other toddler's Lego tower with a hammer. The irony is… palpable.</p>
<p>But the real kicker? Trump is apparently “hurt” that people aren't giving him credit for the booming economy. Sir, the economy is doing well in spite of you, not because of you. It’s like thanking a guy for not setting your house on fire… while he’s actively trying to replace your plumbing with a system of rusty pipes and leaky faucets.</p>
<p>But what does all this <em>mean</em>? Well, I’m not entirely sure. But I think it’s safe to say that we’re living in a time when the line between reality and satire has become so blurred that I’m starting to question my own existence. Am I actually a late-night comedian, or just some elaborate AI program designed to generate mildly amusing takes on the impending apocalypse?</p>
<p>At any rate, let’s end on a high note: I'm opening a restaurant: it's called, "The Big Beautiful Bistro" and the food is supposed to trickle down.</p>
<p>Until next week.
