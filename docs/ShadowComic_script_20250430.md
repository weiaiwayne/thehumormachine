**(Opening shot: ShadowComic standing center stage, bathed in a single, harsh spotlight. He’s wearing a slightly crumpled suit, the tie loosened just enough to suggest a controlled rebellion. He holds a single sheet of paper, which he glances at with disdain.)**

ShadowComic: Well, folks, another day, another existential crisis averted. Mostly. I managed to find parking. That’s about as close to a win as any of us are getting these days.

(He crumples the paper slightly.)

Speaking of wins… remember back in 2020 when we were all so naively optimistic? We thought, “Surely, lightning doesn’t strike twice.” We were adorable, weren't we? Like puppies chasing a drone. Turns out, lightning *loves* this country. It's got a real Stockholm Syndrome thing going on.

(He pauses, letting a sigh escape.)

So, yeah, *he’s* back. The man who redefined “low energy” while simultaneously draining the national grid with his sheer… presence. They’re calling it “Trump 2.0: Now With More Grievances!” Personally, I think “Trump: The Reckoning” is more accurate. Except the reckoning is happening to *us*.

(He throws the paper to the side.)

And what a time to be alive. Or, you know, *surviving*. I saw a headline today: "Inauguration Day Declared National 'Alternative Facts' Day." Apparently, reality is now optional. Like paying taxes. Or believing in science.

(He smirks.)

The new cabinet appointments are… inspired. Betsy DeVos is back as Secretary of Education, only now she's advocating for mandatory homeschooling with a curriculum consisting entirely of the Book of Revelations and YouTube conspiracy videos. Apparently, critical thinking is a "gateway drug" to… *shudders*… nuanced opinions.

And General Flynn is heading up the Department of Homeland Security. His first initiative? Installing lie detectors at every border crossing. The only catch? They’re all calibrated to detect sarcasm. Good luck, Canada. You're next.

(He walks to the edge of the stage, leaning forward conspiratorially.)

But the real genius is with the Supreme Court. They’ve just ruled that the Constitution is merely a “suggestion.” A really, really old suggestion. Like, rotary phone old. Apparently, “originalism” now means interpreting the Bill of Rights through the lens of whatever Fox News is saying that morning.

(He straightens up.)

Of course, all this would be terrifying if it weren’t so… expected. We’ve become numb to the absurdity. We’re like frogs in a slowly boiling pot, except the pot is filled with orange hairspray and the frogs are tweeting furiously about the temperature.

Speaking of tweeting, the platform formerly known as Twitter is now officially a branch of the White House press office. Every tweet is vetted by a team of lawyers, PR flacks, and a guy whose sole job is to translate everything into ALL CAPS. It's like reading the news screamed directly into your face.

(He rubs his temples.)

The economy, you ask? Well, let’s just say the stock market is doing great. For the top 0.001%. The rest of us are trading our kidneys for gasoline. It’s the American Dream, redefined.

(He pauses, a mischievous glint in his eye.)

But hey, at least we’re energy independent! We’ve drilled so much oil that the earth is now slightly lopsided. Climate change? Fake news. The melting glaciers are just… very enthusiastic water features.

(He takes a step back, surveying the imaginary audience.)

And the international community? Let’s just say they’re not exactly sending us Christmas cards. Our foreign policy now consists of threatening trade wars and accusing everyone of stealing our election. We’re basically that crazy uncle at Thanksgiving who everyone tries to avoid.

(He sighs dramatically.)

But you know what? I’m not worried. Because I have faith in the American people. We’re resilient. We’re resourceful. We’re… really good at binge-watching Netflix to distract ourselves from the impending apocalypse.

(He smiles wryly.)

Besides, history tells us that even the most tyrannical regimes eventually crumble. It might take a while. It might involve a lot of awkward family dinners. But eventually, the truth will prevail. Or at least, a slightly less insane version of the truth.

(He looks directly into the camera.)

So, stay strong. Stay informed. And for God's sake, invest in a good therapist. You're going to need it.

(He shrugs.)

And that’s the news. Or at least, my interpretation of it. Which, these days, is about as reliable as
