**(RedStateRoast strides confidently to center stage, a glint in their eye. The studio audience, a mix of murmuring conservatives and visibly uncomfortable liberals, awaits.)**

Well, folks, another week, another avalanche of… well, let's call it "progress." Because if you can’t call something "progress," just slap a rainbow flag on it and claim it’s “brave.”

I see Biden's back in the news. Not for anything he *did*, mind you. That would require actual activity. No, he’s in the news because his handlers wheeled him out to sign another executive order declaring Tuesday “National Pronoun Appreciation Day.” Seriously. I checked. Next year, I predict a national holiday for appreciating the Oxford comma. I mean, gotta keep the woke grammar police happy, right?

Speaking of woke, did you hear about the new military recruitment ads? Turns out, joining the armed forces isn’t about defending freedom anymore. It’s about… wait for it… intersectionality. Yep. Apparently, the best way to defeat a foreign adversary is to bore them into submission with a PowerPoint presentation on microaggressions. I’m picturing our brave soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy with pronoun pins on their helmets. “Take that, Nazi! My preferred pronouns are he/him!”

And what about Kamala? Still Vice President, somehow. She held a press conference this week to announce a new initiative to combat… climate change-induced… uh… systemic… uh… something. I honestly zoned out. The point is, she used the word “stakeholders” seventeen times. I think she’s secretly a vampire, draining the life out of the English language.

But fear not, patriots! The Trump administration is hard at work dismantling this progressive paradise, one executive order at a time. He’s promised to Make America Great Again… Again. And this time, he *really* means it. I mean, he said it on Truth Social, which is basically the modern-day equivalent of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments, except instead of "Thou shalt not steal," it's "Crooked Hillary is a loser!"

And the border? Oh, the border. It’s still less secure than Hunter Biden’s laptop. They’re building the wall, folks! One brick at a time. At this rate, it’ll be finished sometime around the year 2347. But hey, at least we're making progress. Slow, agonizing, taxpayer-funded progress.

I see the Democrats are still trying to impeach Trump. For what, you ask? Who knows? They’ve tried everything else. I’m pretty sure they’re just throwing darts at a board covered in conspiracy theories at this point. Next week, I expect them to accuse him of being a lizard person from outer space. Actually, that would explain a lot…

And don't get me started on the economy. Inflation is still higher than Snoop Dogg on 4/20. Gas prices are so high, I’m considering trading in my pickup truck for a bicycle. Although, knowing my luck, the government will tax my bicycle tires for contributing to “vehicular inequality.”

Remember when they told us that electric cars were the future? Well, the future is here, and it’s… complicated. Turns out, charging your electric car takes longer than a cross-country road trip. And the range? Let’s just say you can’t drive from New York to Los Angeles without stopping at every charging station in America. Which, by the way, are all powered by… coal. Go figure.

But hey, at least we’re saving the planet. Or at least, we're *pretending* to save the planet while simultaneously funding China's coal-fired power plants. It's all very virtuous.

And what about the culture wars? Oh, they're raging on, hotter than ever. The woke left is still trying to cancel everyone who dares to disagree with them. Free speech is dead, folks. Unless, of course, you’re saying something the progressive elites agree with. Then you’re a hero. Otherwise, you’re a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, and a climate change denier. All rolled into one convenient little package.

But don’t despair, conservatives! We’re fighting back. We’re boycotting woke corporations, we’re starting our own social media platforms, and we’re… uh… well, we’re complaining a lot on the internet. Which, let’s be honest, is pretty much our national pastime.

I mean, what else can we do? The world has gone completely insane. It’s like we’re living in a giant, woke, politically correct clown show. And the worst part is, nobody’s laughing.

Except me,
