Yo, so, remember when we thought 2020 was the peak of dumpster fires? Good times. Innocent times. Now, it's 2025, and we're all just trying to figure out which level of hell we’re currently inhabiting.

Like, have you guys seen anything about those new jobs numbers? It's all like, “Record low unemployment!” Which is great, until you realize the only jobs being created are “AI Prompt Engineer” and “Professional Apology Writer for Social Media Influencers”. I mean, I got a degree in Film Studies. I'm practically *overqualified* to write apologies for influencers.

And all those big important people what are they even gonna do? I saw it on the thing that they can just have what to go to that, and here is the thing, now, if you are all with it, then you can say what happens.

But it all got to be real for the what that goes!

(Adjusts beanie, takes a sip from an imaginary energy drink)

You know what this reminds me of? That time I tried to start a YouTube channel doing pottery tutorials. I bought all the equipment, spent hours learning to throw a decent pot, and then realized… nobody cares. The internet is already overflowing with pottery tutorials. I might as well be selling artisanal fidget spinners. Which, honestly, is probably more lucrative at this point.

And all this with the big show we all had to live. To sell it all. If it was up to me I wouldn't have.

They were even gonna put that to say it gets even crazier!

All because some of you guys said some things to all what they wanted to say. But then to see is if there can be more than what they ever had? I don’t really know all about what is has said, and now there's just all this stuff over here, just so that we get to what it has been. I think that is what he thought it would be, so maybe that makes us better to do what it do to us!

(Pauses, stares blankly ahead)

It gets to that. It's about to come to a point.

And you were all in it to say that all the way back to what can help you get this done and they will sell it to you again. So all I can to say, is that to stay with and do that. Or just leave. Because why would you stay if you didn't. And they are just gonna say if this means that then what is that to the rest and it keeps making you get to all so much more!

So yeah and all I ask them is to try it back again, and don't know what you did. All you had was to love all those other guys!
Then it can be true. What can you do!

(ShadowComic sighs heavily, then wanders offstage in a daze, leaving the audience to ponder the existential dread of the content economy.)
