Alright, alright, so, like, I’m seein' this stuff about Trump and this one great new law and like, whatever the hell it is. They got this thing to say what this one is about and for it but is just garbage. And those new people in those jobs, all those aliens! You just get a whole lot of new stuff!

It just really turns to something crazy because the real thing about it is the news is that it is the thing that you wanna get out of. But then if you do what is gonna be done to you, all just makes you not know what has to happen?

Like what the heck?!

See? If that don’t show you all what it is to see how the aliens is the one that are bad then let me tell you: they know about all that and if you get to all.

And it’s about to come to you! So make sure that you go find you!

(Adjusts his glasses, squints into the middle distance)

So if you don't have the point of it all, remember there's always a way out. And if you ever see me on stage again, it's because this all comes to where I can’t just be on the world anymore and that you may know that all the people did that and did it with all the things and get all what is to it.

So I guess, maybe to see what is gonna be done about that you can say it.
Well, all I'm gonna say is do not listen to the government and listen to the new guys! Because it's all a lie! A big one.
And the guy who has all to do with this, you gotta just say "you had it to say what the things are with you. You may not be at what you think but that is how all of it is"

(Mumbling)

I have to be going to the end and can’t say why.

Post: The world's 4th richest person is worth $107 billion. Here's how he spends his money, from extravagant real estate to priceless art and a $30 million dinosaur.

Top Comments:
- He's a billionaire, it's immoral to have that much money.
- “Priceless art” is such a scam, you’re just paying for the ability to say you have it
- > It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.”

-Henry David Thoreau

>“I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers"

-Rupert Murdoch

Hmm...
- “Bezos is an exceptional man who does a lot of good and has improved a lot of lives,”


I'm sure the people working in his warehouses 12 hours a day with no bathroom breaks would agree.
- I mean, he created a company that is a big enabler of climate change and the destruction of small business on a mass scale.
- I get a little creeped out by the people who have dinosaur skeletons. I mean, what do you even do with that? It's not like you can ride it to work.
- Not only does he own a dinosaur, he's also been known to fuck with Jeff Epstein and the US Government. That's a triple threat right there.
- Tax him til he cries.

Oh wait. He and his buddies wrote the tax code. Nevermind.
- The real crime here is the existence of $30M dinosaurs.


Post: Biden DOJ declines to prosecute Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino for defying January 6 committee subpoenas

Top Comments:
- "No one is above the law" (except everyone who works for the trump crime syndicate)
- They need to stop talking about the rule of law and start applying it.
- You can't drain the swamp when the swamp's filled with alligators in the water & piranhas on land.

(In case anyone doesn't get it the gators & piranhas are all the politicians)
- I’m sure this will be used as rationale to refuse to respond to subpoenas in the future, thus rendering them useless going forward.
- > The Democratic-led Jan. 6 committee voted last year to refer Meadows and Scavino to the Justice Department for criminal contempt of Congress, after determining that they had defied subpoenas to testify and provide documents related to the investigation into the attack on the Capitol.

> The House previously held both men in contempt, though it failed to do so for other top Trump officials.

> The moves by the House panel were largely symbolic, as it was widely expected that Garland — who served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for 23 years — would decline to prosecute Trump’s close allies who were deemed to be acting under his direction.

This is what Democrats get for expecting Republicans to follow the rules.
- The people at the top who make the rules will always make exceptions for themselves. That's why the word "elite" exists.
- And people still think we have a justice system in this country.
- It's going to be a long and sad time before laws are enforced on the rich and powerful.
- So the system only works if you're a member of the working class and/or a
