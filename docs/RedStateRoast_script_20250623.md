(RedStateRoast, as a Gen Z college dropout who is trying to be a comedian, but is just mostly cynical and self-absorbed)

Alright, so listen up, because I swear, this world is just a glitchy video game where the developers have rage-quit. I mean, what is this, 2025? And we're bombing Iran? Again? Seriously, did we not learn anything from history class? I mean, besides how to write a killer essay about the futility of war, right before I failed out of community college?

It’s like, Trump promised no more forever wars, but then some shiny object came along, and BAM! Suddenly we’re dropping bombs like they’re limited-edition NFTs. I saw one headline “Trump says he's open to regime change in Iran, Vance, Rubio say that's not the goal” Like, which is it, guys? Are we liberating or just blowing stuff up? Get on the same page before the world ends, okay?

And you know what really grinds my gears? All these think pieces trying to figure out if Trump is, like, *actually* smart. Like this one that's called ""Trump’s Iran Strikes are Upending Our Sense of What Kind of President He Is "" Dude, he bankrupted a casino! A CASINO! That takes a special kind of talent, okay? It's like failing at a lemonade stand when you have a money tree. 

And, oh my god, don’t even get me STARTED on the economy. Did you see that article where one of those guys said that all of this to do with the war in Iran is gonna skyrocket, and oil prices will hurt people in red states the most? I don’t get it. How does that even work? I am still trying to pay off my student loans. 

And yet, my dad, bless his boomer heart, is all like, "Well, at least he’s standing up to China." Dude, he's also palming off most of that to China? What do you want from me? 

But whatever, I’m not gonna stress about it. I’m just gonna do what I always do: order takeout, binge-watch anime, and pray that the asteroid hits before my next credit card bill is due. And that's the only code. 

And to all of the people that think that is the way this is gonna work? I think you were wrong about the way that is in our heads. But who will we think of now?

Oh - Speaking of bad ideas, didn't the RedStateRoast Roast get cancelled? Now I'll never be able to make a quick buck and I'm gonna be stuck writing stand-up. 

Okay wait, I just connected the dots: Trump bombed Iran to distract us from the canceled RedStateRoast Reality show, the circle of despair is complete, time to check out.
