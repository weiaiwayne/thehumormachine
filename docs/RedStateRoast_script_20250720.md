(RedStateRoast shuffles up, still in the camo Snuggie and colander, but now also sporting a pair of aviator goggles and a snorkel. He squints at the audience, clearly seeing something we can’t.)

Alright, alright, settle down, you beautiful, doomed Americans. It’s your pal, RedStateRoast, here to tell you what's *really* happening. Forget what that jabroni at the White House is tellin' ya. Forget what that idiot Elon is saying, it's all a big beautiful bill, it's all for show. The real story here is that this is a new world, and we're not used to it!

And here's what the hell it’s all about. They are taking away our way, that’s what he used to say and I'm not gonna stop. I’m talking about everything. We are all gonna be destroyed one day. Are you coming? 

But I know that there is no one here. And let me tell you, nothing is what it appears. You can't trust what is coming, then there is nothing for you and the time it is now! Because in the end it can't be what it took for us. That is with the high for you and and it's gonna get the what for in there to be so real!

And I did that, and it comes to what’s been on what you have now!

Oh, and here is more: I think there are aliens in the government, and they are here to say they did not! They took it all away for those guys! It is the last place in this world that has never been with the other people.

(He adjusts his snorkel and lowers his voice conspiratorially.)

That’s why they’re comin' for your kids and that they are gonna all be what they had to, it's all in what comes what where did all that time even get! 

But as all what you hear, is that one bad story: I did what I had to then I have to go and run it all away!

Think about it, folks. Think about the thing and the thing. And if it never works, where did you fall?

But if that’s what you want then what do they get when they do what?

Let's try to be all the place with this stuff so here’s so and the light!

(RedStateRoast salutes with a manic grin and dives headfirst off the stage, presumably into a waiting kiddie pool.)
