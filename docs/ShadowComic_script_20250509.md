Good evening, patriots… and algorithm-resistant holdouts. Or, as the Department of Homeland Security now calls you, “Persons of Interest 3.0.”

So, another week in the glorious, re-re-re-re-re-United States of America. Feels good, doesn't it? Like a warm bath. A warm bath filled with industrial runoff and the faint scent of desperation.

Speaking of warm baths, President Trump unveiled his new economic plan this week. It’s called “Making America Great… Again… Again… Again… For Real This Time.” The cornerstone? Tax cuts for… well, you can guess. Turns out, trickling down economics is less like a gentle spring shower and more like a burst pipe in Mar-a-Lago, flooding only the basement with gold-plated toilets.

And the trickle-down? That’s mostly… well, let’s just say the official White House press release now refers to it as “nutrient-rich fertilizer for the American Dream.” I’m pretty sure that’s just a fancy way of saying we’re all getting crapped on.

He also announced a new initiative to combat… “radical woke indoctrination” in schools. Apparently, teaching kids about history that happened *before* 2016 is now considered subversive. The new curriculum? “American Exceptionalism: The Uncensored Version (Starring Donald J. Trump as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and the guy who invented sliced bread. All at the same time.)”

The textbooks are printed on gold foil, naturally. Because nothing says “affordable education” like a textbook you can pawn for a month’s rent.

And the Supreme Court? Oh, they’re just… *chefs kiss*. You know, at this point, I'm half expecting them to rule that the Earth is flat, just to own the libs. They did overturn the 22nd Amendment this week. Term limits? So last century. Apparently, the Founding Fathers were just being "unnecessarily restrictive" in their vision of a "dynamic" and "ever-evolving" nation.

Remember checks and balances? Now it's more like a check bounces, and then the entire system collapses under the weight of its own hubris.

But hey, at least we’re winning the culture war! Unless, of course, you consider "winning" to mean having your Netflix recommendations replaced with 24/7 coverage of Trump rallies. Which, let’s be honest, is pretty much what’s happening.

And the media? Well, Fox News is now officially designated as the “State-Approved News Source.” CNN is running a 24-hour loop of puppies playing in a field. And MSNBC? They’ve rebranded as “MAGA-NBC,” featuring a daily segment called “Liberal Tears: A Delicious Recipe for Patriotic Soup.”

I’m starting to think Orwell underestimated the power of reality television.

Speaking of television, the new season of “The Apprentice: Government Edition” is a real nail-biter. This year, contestants are vying for the coveted position of… Secretary of Absolutely Everything. The challenges include: deporting illegal immigrants using only a tweet, negotiating world peace with a golf club, and explaining the difference between “affect” and “effect” to the President. The elimination round involves a lie detector test… conducted by Rudy Giuliani.

And foreign policy? Let’s just say things are… *interesting*. We’re officially at war with… well, pretty much everyone who isn’t selling us oil at rock-bottom prices. Our allies? They’re mostly hiding under their desks, hoping we don’t notice them. The UN is now headquartered in… wait for it… North Korea. Apparently, Kim Jong-un offered them a really good deal on office space.

But hey, at least the economy is booming… for a select few. The stock market is soaring! The national debt? Not so much. But who cares about the future when you can have a solid-gold toilet right now?

And the resistance? Well, we’re still here. We’re organizing. We’re protesting. We’re… mostly just trying to avoid getting flagged by the facial recognition software. The good news is, we’ve developed a new form of protest that’s virtually undetectable: passive-aggressive knitting. We’re knitting subversive messages into MAGA hats. It’s slow, it’s painstaking, but it’s surprisingly effective. Plus, it keeps us warm at night.

So, chin up, folks. The world may be going to hell in a handbasket, but at least we’re all in it together. And remember, laughter is the best medicine… unless you have a pre-existing
