Good evening, patriots and… well, whatever's left of everyone else. Welcome back to “Truth Decay,” the only show brave enough to tell you what you already suspect is happening, but are too exhausted to fully process.

So, another week in the Glorious American Re-Awakening. Or, as I prefer to call it, “The Great Beigeing.” Beige walls, beige opinions, beige everything except, of course, the President's… well, you know. That's still a vibrant, screaming orange, like a Cheeto dipped in nuclear waste.

Speaking of our Fearless Leader, he held another rally this week. This time in… Boise, Idaho. Boise! I didn’t even know that still *existed*. Apparently, the strategic imperative was to “own the libs” by showcasing the nation’s potato reserves. He actually stood on a giant mound of russets and declared, "These potatoes… they're like America. Strong. Mealy. And easily fried." The crowd went wild. I think they were just hungry.

But the real kicker? He then unveiled his new national initiative: “Make America Grate Again.” The plan? To replace all public art with giant cheese graters. His reasoning? "Because liberals hate cheese graters. They're too… pointy. Too… *effective*." I’m not even making this up. I wish I was. My therapist certainly wishes I was.

And the Supreme Court? Oh, honey, they're just *thriving*. They just overturned the concept of "gravity" because, according to Justice… well, let's just call him Justice "I Heart My Yacht," “Gravity is just another form of government overreach. People should be allowed to float wherever they want. It's called freedom!" I’m expecting spontaneous human combustion to become the next big thing. Literally.

Meanwhile, the Department of Education has announced a new curriculum for schools. History is now being taught entirely through interpretive dance. Apparently, the Battle of Gettysburg is a lot more palatable when set to a polka beat. And, naturally, the Holocaust is now a lighthearted tap routine about the importance of personal hygiene. I swear, some days, I think I’ve slipped into a particularly bleak episode of "The Twilight Zone" directed by Mel Brooks after a really bad mushroom trip.

And remember that whole "Space Force" thing? Well, it's now the "Space *Guard*." Turns out, they mostly just stand around in orbit, yelling at passing asteroids to "Get off our lawn!" They're also tasked with preventing illegal immigration from Mars. Apparently, Elon Musk's latest colony is teeming with undocumented… uh… Martians? I don't know. I stopped trying to understand the logistics a long time ago.

Oh, and the economy? It’s… well, it’s “doing great!” according to the President. Which, I guess, is technically true if you’re a shareholder in a company that manufactures platinum-plated dentures for Pomeranians. For the rest of us, it’s more like living in a dystopian barter system where the only acceptable currency is bottle caps and compliments on the President's… you know.

But hey, at least we're "winning," right? Winning at what, exactly? I have no freaking clue. But we’re winning! We’re winning so much, we’re practically drowning in winning. It’s like a giant, orange-flavored tsunami of winning, and I'm just here, treading water, trying to figure out how to build a raft out of discarded cheese graters and interpretive dance textbooks.

The good news is, I did manage to get a reservation at that new restaurant that only serves food shaped like the President's… well, you get the idea. Apparently, the signature dish is a "Tiny Trump Tower" made entirely of mashed sweet potatoes. I hear it's surprisingly… palatable.

But before I go, a quick public service announcement: If you see a man wearing a MAGA hat and carrying a cheese grater, do not approach him. Just slowly back away and pretend you're a potato. It might just save your life.

And that, my friends, is all the truth decay I can handle for one night. Stay vigilant. Stay caffeinated. And for the love of all that is holy, *hide your cheese*.
