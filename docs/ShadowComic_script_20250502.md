Alright, alright, settle down, you beautiful remnants of a once-proud nation. Or, as the Department of Re-Education prefers to call you, “compliant citizens undergoing voluntary thought realignment.”

I’ve been scouring the bowels of the internet again, folks. You know, that dark corner where the remnants of free thought still flicker like a dying LED bulb in a Trump-branded nightlight. And let me tell you, the news is… well, it’s news.

First up, apparently, the new national bird is now the bald eagle… wearing a tiny MAGA hat. Symbolism, they say. Patriotism. I say, someone clearly hasn't seen an eagle try to balance anything on its head. It's less majestic, more like a feathered clown act. I give it three months before PETA gets involved. Though, at this point, PETA probably just rebrands as "Patriots Enduring Trump's Absurdities."

And speaking of rebranding, remember the Environmental Protection Agency? Yeah, they're now the "Energy Promotion Authority." Their mission statement? "To promote the vibrant and unbridled exploitation of all natural resources, in the name of American Greatness…again!" I hear their new slogan is "Drill, Baby, Drill… until there’s nothing left to drill into!" Catchy, right? It’s got that certain… apocalyptic charm.

Oh, and the Supreme Court? Let’s just say they’re so far right, they’re practically orbiting Uranus. The latest ruling? Corporations now have the legal right to *literally* own your thoughts. They call it “Cognitive Property Rights.” Apparently, that brilliant idea you had in the shower about a self-cleaning toilet? Yeah, Monsanto owns it now. Better luck next time inventing something useful, like a new shade of orange for the President’s complexion.

I saw a Reddit thread about the new curriculum in schools. History class now focuses primarily on the Trump dynasty. They’ve even replaced the Pledge of Allegiance with the “Promise of Perpetual Allegiance to the Trump Brand.” I’m not sure what’s more terrifying, the blatant indoctrination or the fact that kids are now fluent in Trump-speak. I overheard a group of eight-year-olds arguing over the merits of different tariffs on imported bouncy castles the other day. It was… surreal.

And the border wall? Still going strong! Although, apparently, they’re having some issues with structural integrity. Turns out, building a giant concrete wall on constantly shifting desert sands is… not the smartest engineering feat. But hey, at least it looks great! Especially with the new commemorative Trump-themed graffiti. You know, inspirational quotes like "Build the Wall!" and "Lock Her Up!" sprayed in gold leaf. Classy.

The economy, you ask? Booming! At least, according to the official figures released by the Ministry of Truth… I mean, the Department of Economic Optimism. Unemployment is at an all-time low… unless you happen to be a journalist, a scientist, a librarian, or anyone who disagrees with the President. Then, you’re just… “taking a break.” A very, very long break. With government-sponsored relocation to scenic… undisclosed locations.

And the international scene? Let’s just say we’re making *friends* everywhere. Mostly with countries that also have strongmen leaders and questionable human rights records. We’re bonding over shared interests, like suppressing dissent and building really, really tall buildings with our names on them. It's a bromance for the ages.

There's also this fascinating Reddit conspiracy theory about the President's hair. Apparently, it's not actually hair. It's a highly advanced form of sentient alien life that controls his every thought and action. I'm not saying I believe it… but I'm also not *not* saying I believe it. At this point, it's probably the most plausible explanation for everything.

I even saw a post asking if anyone remembers what irony is. Someone replied, “Isn’t that that stuff you use to smooth out wrinkles on your ‘Make America Great Again’ hat?” I think that pretty much sums it up.

But hey, look on the bright side! At least we have… well… we have… freedom fries! Yeah, that’s it. Freedom fries! Still going strong. As long as you don’t ask where they’re sourced from. Or who’s allowed to eat them. Or what happens if you accidentally call them “French fries.” Let
