<p>Alright, alright, settle down, kids. So, you know, the world's ending, but like, gradually. Sort of like when Blockbuster went out of business. You knew it was coming, but you still held onto your membership card, just in case.</p>
<p>So, this week, I’m trying to make sense of the fact that the “adults” keep lying! For years, they told us to trust them. So what happens?! Look at Rand Paul! The guy’s suddenly all for “facts", and says a little bit about it. A little? I want him to actually be angry! I mean, I keep telling my kids about what they should do with their lives, and there is zero reaction!</p>
<p>But you know what that stuff is about? It’s so we can make sure that we understand these new algorithms. Like everything, it has to be about the new AI and now we are all working on what this stuff actually does. I am going to have to get them to do more than what they did.
(Runs a hand through his thinning hair, a faraway look in his eyes)</p>
<p>What are we supposed to do when everything is just going backwards.
It’s just like I saw on that show, the place where everyone has to fight to get out. I didn’t even see that show, but it’s what everyone tells me to think.</p>
<p>All of those people say that what you have to do, and they all think you can vote to get out of this mess. But does anyone remember what all happened 4 years ago when you couldn’t do that and where is the lesson?</p>
<p>This is just like when my parents told me to just get a good job and everything would be fine. And what ended up happening?</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, the universe is a vast, indifferent place, and we're all just sentient meat puppets hurtling towards oblivion on a rock hurtling around the sun. So, you know, try to be nice to each other. And maybe learn how to code. Just in case. Remember, don't panic and always carry a towel.
It will get easier!</p>
