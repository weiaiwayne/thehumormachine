    <p>(Lights up on ShadowComic, leaning against a faux-brick wall. He’s wearing a “Make Peace, Not Content” t-shirt, several sizes too big. His persona is that of a cynical millennial who is beyond being surprised by anything anymore.)</p>
<p>ShadowComic: So, another day, another potential World War. Honestly, I'm starting to think "apocalypse fatigue" is a real thing. Like, remember dial-up? That's what my brain feels like when I try to process this Trump-Iran situation. Just a constant, irritating <em>eeeeeeeeeeee</em> until it disconnects and I go back to doomscrolling cat videos.</p>
<p>Anyway, Trump bombed some nuclear sites. Apparently, he's going for that “Make Iran Great Again” slogan. I guess that means bringing back… <em>radioactive camels</em>?</p>
<p>And of course, nobody bothered to ask Congress about this whole “bombing a sovereign nation” thing. You know, that whole “War Powers Act” thing? Apparently, it’s just a suggestion. Like eating your vegetables or… <em>paying your interns</em>.</p>
<p>And the MAGA crowd? They're all over the place. Some are like, "Yeah! Take down those nuke-loving ayatollahs!" Others are like, "Wait, wasn't Trump the ‘no more wars’ guy? What happened to the ‘endless wars’?" It’s like watching a flock of pigeons try to do synchronized swimming. Complete chaos.</p>
<p>Then there's Marjorie Taylor Greene, my god, now <em>she's</em> against the war. As if the fact that someone that is a mix between a Ken doll and a Neanderthal is a voice of reason. I don't know if this means she's finally finding the limits of her brain, or that the government is run by the Russian bots.</p>
<p>But the real kicker? Turns out, after he ordered the Iran strikes, Trump wanted oil producers to keep prices down. He literally told them to <em>make less money</em>. I'm pretty sure Econ 101 is a prerequisite for running a lemonade stand, let alone a superpower. But hey, who needs economics when you have… <em>vibes</em>?</p>
<p>It’s all so exhausting. It’s like, can we fast-forward to the part where we all live in underground bunkers eating nutrient paste and playing VR Sims? I’m sure it’s just a coincidence that Oracle is buying like $40 billion in Nvidia chips for OpenAI. Mark my words - the robots are coming, they're building themselves new bodies, and they're going to be <em>very</em> disappointed in what they find.</p>
<p>And it’s only going to get worse, because someone who can’t grasp the concept of supply and demand, is about to engage in a new level of tariff trickery, like he did in the last one. So don’t be surprised if that 50% discount on furniture from Temu vanishes, and ends up costing you more in the long run.</p>
<p>So, yeah. World War III might be trending, but I'm over here just trying to figure out if I should invest in canned goods or… <em>therapy</em>. Actually, scratch that. I can’t afford either. Guess I’ll just… <em>doomscroll</em>. At least it's free. You know, like our… <em>future</em>.
