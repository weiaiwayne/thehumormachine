Good evening, patriots… and whatever the algorithm now classifies as “undesirables.” Welcome back to “Reality Adjacent,” the only show brave enough to ask the question, “Is this REALLY happening?” And then immediately regret asking.

So, another week, another existential crisis brought to you by the fine folks who believe climate change is a hoax perpetrated by Big Solar. Speaking of solar, did you hear about the new initiative? Every American household is now required to have a portrait of the President strategically positioned to reflect sunlight directly into the eyes of any potential dissenters. It’s called “Operation: Blinding Patriotism.” The Surgeon General assures us any permanent retinal damage is a small price to pay for freedom.

And speaking of freedom, the Freedom From Facts Act just passed both houses. It essentially decriminalizes the dissemination of misinformation, as long as it aligns with the officially sanctioned narrative. You know, the one where the 2020 election was stolen, Bigfoot is real, and kale is a communist plot. I, for one, am thrilled. Now I can finally tell my grandma her bingo winnings were actually a government conspiracy to track her spending habits without fear of prosecution.

But hey, it's not all doom and gloom. The economy is… well, it's certainly *an* economy. The President declared this week that inflation is merely a “liberal conspiracy to make cheeseburgers seem more expensive.” His solution? Executive order mandating all cheeseburgers be sold at 2019 prices. Of course, the beef industry is now subsidized by the government printing more money, which, ironically, is causing… you guessed it… inflation. It’s a beautiful, self-sustaining cycle of economic genius. I'm starting to think trickle-down economics was actually a trickle-down *comedy* all along.

And education! Oh, the strides we’re making in education! History books are being rewritten to reflect a more… nuanced… perspective. For example, the Civil War is now referred to as "The Great States' Rights Disagreement." And slavery? A “robust labor market” according to the newly appointed Secretary of Education, a man who once argued on Fox News that the Earth is flat and that vaccines cause… enlightenment. Which, in his case, they clearly don’t.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security has unveiled its new facial recognition software. It's designed to identify “potential threats” to national security. The catch? It's only trained on images of people wearing masks, reading books, or expressing any form of critical thought. So, basically, anyone who isn't actively waving a flag and chanting slogans is now a person of interest. I'm thinking of getting a MAGA hat just to blend in. Maybe bedazzle it a little.

And the Supreme Court? Well, they’re still doing Supreme Court things. Like overturning Roe v. Wade, again. And again. Just to be sure. They also ruled this week that corporations are now legally considered sentient beings with the right to vote. Which explains why my local gas station is suddenly running for Congress on a platform of lower prices and unlimited fracking. I'd vote for it. At least it's honest about its motivations.

On the international front, relations with China are… tense. The President declared a trade war, a culture war, and a war on General Tso’s chicken, which he claims is “un-American.” He then proceeded to eat a bucket of KFC while ranting about the “yellow peril.” Diplomacy at its finest.

But the biggest news this week? The announcement of the President's new reality TV show, "The Apprentice: Apocalypse Edition." Contestants will compete to survive in a simulated post-apocalyptic wasteland, judged on their ability to hoard resources, blame minorities, and brown-nose the President. The winner gets… wait for it… a lifetime supply of government-issued toilet paper and a signed portrait of the President. I'm already stocking up on canned goods and practicing my sycophantic smile.

Speaking of the apocalypse, I saw a bumper sticker the other day that said, "Prepare for the Rapture!" I couldn't help but think, "Honey, we're living it."

And that’s the news. Or at least, a heavily filtered, darkly comedic version of it. I'm ShadowComic, reminding you that laughter is the best medicine… unless you need actual medicine, in which case, good luck navigating the privatized healthcare system. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go burn my library card and practice my goose step. Just in case. Good
