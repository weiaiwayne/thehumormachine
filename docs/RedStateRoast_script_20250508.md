Good evening, patriots and, well, the other guys too. Welcome back to "Truth Hurts, Snowflake," the only show brave enough to say what you’re all thinking, but too afraid to tweet.

So, another week, another win for America. And by America, I mean, of course, the *real* America. The one that still flies flags, eats meat, and hasn’t yet figured out what pronouns are.

First up, let’s talk about the economy. You know, that thing that was miraculously fixed the second President Trump walked back into the Oval Office. Remember those dark days under… what was his name again? The guy who liked ice cream and naptime? Yeah, him. Now, the Dow is higher than Hunter Biden on a Tuesday, inflation is lower than Kamala Harris’ approval rating, and everyone’s getting rich. Except, you know, the people who deserve to be poor. That's just good old fashioned capitalism at work.

And speaking of work, I see the woke mob is still trying to ruin everything. Apparently, demanding you show up on time, sober, and without pronouns tattooed on your forehead is now considered "oppressive." Newsflash, snowflakes: it’s called being a productive member of society. Maybe try it sometime instead of protesting in your Che Guevara t-shirt while daddy pays your rent.

Oh, and the climate alarmists are still at it, too. Apparently, the world is going to end in twelve years. Again. You know, they’ve been saying that since Al Gore invented the internet. I’m starting to think these guys just want attention. Maybe they should try getting a real job, like coal mining. It’s good, honest work, and it helps keep the lights on so they can watch Netflix and complain about the weather.

And let's talk about the border. It's tighter than Don Jr.'s wallet at a charity auction. President Trump, in his infinite wisdom, has finally solved the immigration problem. Turns out, all it took was building a really, really big wall and threatening to deport anyone who looks at you funny. Who knew? The liberals said it couldn't be done. They said it was inhumane. I say, tell that to the taxpayers who are tired of footing the bill for illegal aliens and their anchor babies.

Now, some of you may have noticed that Vice President Don Jr. has been unusually quiet lately. Well, sources tell me he’s been busy working on a top-secret project. Apparently, he’s developing a new line of MAGA-themed NFTs. Because nothing says “stick it to the elites” like buying a digital image of a bald eagle wearing a red hat for $10,000. I'm kidding, of course. They're going to be $15,000.

And of course, no week would be complete without some fresh outrage from the universities. Apparently, Yale is now offering a course on "Deconstructing Whiteness." I swear, these people are actively trying to make themselves irrelevant. I mean, who needs a degree in "Deconstructing Whiteness" when you can get a job at Starbucks and lecture customers on the evils of capitalism?

I also saw a headline about a professor getting fired for saying there are only two genders. Two genders! Can you believe it? In this day and age, stating a basic biological fact is considered a fireable offense. What happened to free speech? Oh, right, the woke mob canceled it. I guess we should just be grateful they haven’t come for our guns yet. Although, knowing them, they’re probably working on it.

Speaking of guns, I'd like to give a shout-out to the NRA, who have just announced their new line of AR-15s designed specifically for children. They're smaller, lighter, and come in a variety of fun colors, like "Patriot Pink" and "Liberty Blue." Because nothing says "responsible parenting" like arming your six-year-old with a semi-automatic rifle.

And finally, let's not forget about the ongoing investigation into the 2020 election. Because, you know, even though it’s been five years, and we've had another election since then, we still need to get to the bottom of it. I mean, sure, there’s no evidence of widespread fraud, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. And besides, what else are Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell going to do with their time?

So, there you have it, folks. Another week in the greatest country on Earth, where the economy is booming, the border is secure, and
