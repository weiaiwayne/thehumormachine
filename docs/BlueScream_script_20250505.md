**(Opening sequence: BlueScream theme music, a frenetic montage of news clips – mostly Trump speaking, oil spills, and confused-looking AI robots.)**

**(BlueScream walks onto the stage to lukewarm applause, adjusts his tie, and surveys the audience with a weary smile.)**

**BlueScream:** Well, good evening. Or, as I like to call it, Tuesday. Because, let's be honest, every day feels like Groundhog Day, except instead of Bill Murray learning to play the piano, it's us learning to tolerate another press briefing where Kayleigh McEnany's AI-generated avatar gaslights the entire nation with the unwavering conviction of a dial-up modem.

**(Beat. He takes a sip from a water bottle labeled “Truth Serum – Do Not Ingest.”)**

So, yeah, Trump's back. Again. It’s like America decided to binge-watch its own worst reality show and then hit "replay." Remember when we thought the biggest threat to democracy was Russian bots? Turns out, it was just our own collective amnesia. We’re basically the goldfish of nations. We circle the tank, see the same plastic castle, and go, "Ooh, shiny! New!"

And what a shiny, new… old… thing he is. He’s like that fruitcake your grandma makes every Christmas: nobody wants it, nobody eats it, but it’s still there, inexplicably, year after year, radiating a strange, unsettling energy.

This time around, though, things are… different. Subtly. Like when you realize your favorite cereal company secretly changed the recipe and now it tastes vaguely of sadness.

For instance, remember "Make America Great Again?" That's out. Now it's "Make America Slightly Less Terrible Than It Could Be, Considering the Circumstances." Catchy, right? Focus groups apparently loved it. Said it was "relatable."

And the cabinet? Oh, the cabinet is a masterpiece of ironic casting. Secretary of Education is now Betsy DeVos's hologram. Apparently, the real Betsy is busy colonizing Mars with a fleet of private school yachts. Secretary of Energy is a Roomba that keeps getting stuck on the Oval Office rug. And Secretary of State is… well, it's still Rudy Giuliani. Some things, apparently, are unfixable. Like a broken toaster or the Republican Party's sense of shame.

**(He pauses, looking deeply into the camera.)**

But it's not all doom and gloom. There are some… advancements. For example, remember those "alternative facts" from the last administration? Now they're just called "custom realities." You can literally buy them on Amazon Prime. Choose your own adventure! Want to believe the Earth is flat? Boom, delivered to your doorstep in two business days. Want to believe you won the lottery? Just download the "Prosperity Package" and your bank account will *feel* richer. It's the American Dream, personalized and pre-packaged for maximum delusion.

And speaking of the American Dream, it's now exclusively available as a limited-edition NFT. All proceeds go to funding the President's new golf course on the moon. Apparently, he's tired of Earth's gravity messing with his swing. I can’t help but feel that’s a metaphor for something, but I’m too tired to unpack it.

**(He gestures to a screen displaying a news headline: "Congress Debates Bill to Mandate National Anthem Be Sung Entirely in Emoji.")**

And Congress! Oh, bless their hearts. They're still diligently working on the important issues. Like this bill to mandate the national anthem be sung entirely in emoji. Apparently, it’s supposed to foster national unity. Because nothing says "land of the free, home of the brave" like a string of dancing ladies, pizza slices, and a tiny, weeping face.

I’m not even kidding. This is where we are. We’re so far down the rabbit hole, Alice is sending us postcards from Wonderland saying, "Get out while you still can. It's not worth it."

**(He leans into the microphone, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.)**

But here's the thing. I think… I *think*… there's a method to the madness. Trump’s not just being a… well, a Trump. He's playing 5D chess. He's deliberately making everything so absurd, so ridiculous, so utterly bonkers, that we'll eventually just… give up. We'll throw our hands up in the air and say, "Okay, fine. You win. Just… please, make it stop."

And then, he'll declare himself Emperor of America. And we'll all be forced to wear those little red hats and eat nothing but well-done steak with
