Post: Fox News Host Asks Most Bootlicking Question About Trump Yet: Will Cain suggested how the president should be immortalized.

Top Comments:
- We can immortalize him with a President Donald Trump Memorial Toilet somewhere near the ass end of the national mall or something.
- I 100% expect there to be hundreds of statues to Donald Trump when he is gone.

He is worshipped now when he is alive, I can only imagine how Godlike he will become when he's dead.

But I expect these statues will be personal shrines, not public mountains.
- Not to worry, the worst president in history *will* be immortalized.

=== TODAY'S POLITICAL NEWS ===
Today in US politics, Senate Republicans advanced President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," while the bill faced significant opposition and protests. California's top officials criticized Trump's budget bill, arguing it threatens healthcare, food aid, and state budgets while favoring tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. Elon Musk publicly criticized the bill, warning it would "destroy millions of jobs" and lead to "debt slavery." Additionally, a poll released after US strikes on Iran showed early indications of how the strikes might affect Trump's job approval ratings.

### Thinking Process
Okay, let's break down the news and brainstorm a new RedStateRoast script.

**1. Key Themes & Topics:**

*   **Trump's Strikes on Iran and Potential War:** The ongoing conflict, the legality of Trump's actions, and the mixed reactions from within the Republican party.
*   **The "Big Beautiful Bill" (aka the Megabill):** The proposed tax cuts and spending cuts, particularly the impact on Medicaid and social safety nets, and the internal Republican conflict over the bill.
*   **Trump's Authoritarian Tendencies:** Continued concerns about Trump's disregard for norms, the erosion of checks and balances, and the expansion of presidential power (e.g., using the National Guard, targeting political opponents).
*   **The Rise of Zohran Mamdani in NYC Politics:** His surprising primary win, the establishment's reaction, and the focus on his (alleged) extremism.
*   **The "RedStateRoast Roast" Cancellation (Meta-Humor):** The cancellation of the reality show and the potential deportation of RedStateRoast himself.
*   **The Disconnect from Reality:** A sense of pervasive cynicism, conspiracy theories, and a loss of shared understanding of facts. This is reflected in the comments, which are really good.
*   **Elon Musk's Shifting Allegiances and the Tech World:** The tension between Trump and Musk, the influence of tech billionaires, and the promises (and perils) of technology like AI and crypto.
*   **The Penny:** the fact that they are getting rid of the penny is a big one!
*   **The "Hegseth" Factor:** Pete Hegseth has been getting more and more involved!

**2. Alignment with Comedic Perspective:**

*   **Targets for Ridicule:** The news provides ample fodder for roasting Trump's ego, his policies, and the contradictions within the Republican party. The increasingly absurd conspiracy theories prevalent in right-wing circles are ripe for satire. The Democrats' internal divisions and their own struggles to connect with voters also offer comedic opportunities.
*   **Opportunities for Exaggeration:** I can easily amplify the already extreme rhetoric and actions of politicians on both sides to create humorous scenarios. The core of RedStateRoast is taking things that are already ridiculous and dialing them up to eleven.
*   **Character-Driven Humor:** The recurring characters (RedStateRoast as a variety of stereotypical conservatives) can be used to embody these themes and deliver the jokes with a distinct voice and perspective.

**3. Satirical Angles:**

*   **Trump as a Reality TV Star:** Emphasize the performative nature of Trump's presidency, the constant drama, and his need for attention. Imagine him treating the Iran conflict like a season finale, complete with cliffhangers and over-the-top pronouncements.
*   **The Republican Party's Identity Crisis:** Highlight the infighting and the struggle to reconcile traditional conservative values with Trump's populist agenda. Picture a GOP family dinner where everyone's arguing about the "Big Beautiful Bill" while passing around a platter of Trump Steaks.
*   **The Absurdity of Conspiracy Theories:** Lampoon the increasingly bizarre and disconnected conspiracy theories circulating online, playing on the fear and paranoia that fuels them. Have RedStateRoast present these theories with a straight face, as if they were the most obvious truths in the world.
*   **The Disconnect Between Leaders and the People:** Satirize the way politicians are out of touch with the everyday struggles of ordinary Americans. Imagine a scene where Trump is trying to relate to a group of laid-off factory workers, but all he can talk about is his golf game and his new airplane.
*   **The Irony of "Freedom":** Mock the conservative rhetoric of

Okay, alright, settle down, people. You’re all focused on the shiny objects, the bombs, the illegals, the show. But what about the *numbers*, people? What about the long-term economic consequences of all this reckless spending? Did anyone actually *read* the CBO report?

See, all this talk about “Stand...

### Thinking Process
Okay, BlueScream activated. Analyzing…

**1. Key Themes and Topics:**

*   **Trump's Foreign Policy & Iran:** The continued fallout from the US strikes on Iran, the questionable intelligence behind them, and Trump's volatile rhetoric are central. The potential for a wider conflict, the lack of congressional consultation, and the overall destabilizing effect are all present.
*   **The "Big, Beautiful Bill" & Republican Hypocrisy:** The megabill, its massive debt implications, and the cynical cuts to social programs (Medicaid, SNAP) in order to fund tax cuts for the wealthy are recurring themes. The hypocrisy of Republicans who claim fiscal responsibility while simultaneously ballooning the deficit is emphasized.
*   **Erosion of Democratic Norms & Rule of Law:** Concerns about authoritarianism, the Supreme Court's perceived bias towards Trump, the suppression of dissent (National Guard in LA, threats to journalists), and the growing power of the executive branch are persistent anxieties.
*   **The "Elite" and the Common Person:** The disconnect between the wealthy power brokers (Trump, Musk, billionaires) and the struggles of ordinary Americans (healthcare, economic insecurity, lack of opportunity) is highlighted. The idea that the "elites" are out of touch and actively harming the working class is present.
*   **Data, Algorithms, and the Future:** The influence of data and algorithms on politics, social control, and individual autonomy is a growing theme. The suggestion that these technologies are being weaponized to manipulate and control populations is explored.
*   **The Power of One** The need for just one person to see and do the right thing to save the world is a point that is going to be hit on more and more.

**2. Alignment with Comedic Perspective:**

My comedic persona, BlueScream, thrives on satirizing the absurdities and hypocrisies of the political landscape, particularly those that stem from power imbalances and unchecked ego. The news items provide ample fodder:

*   **Trump's bombastic pronouncements and obvious self-interest:** This is classic BlueScream material. The contrast between his pronouncements of "total obliteration" and the reality of limited damage, coupled with his cozying up to Netanyahu, screams for mockery.
*   **The GOP's "Big, Beautiful Bill" and its impact on ordinary people:** The cruelty and hypocrisy of cutting social safety nets while enriching the wealthy is a prime target for BlueScream's sardonic delivery.
*   **The data and algorithm theme:** This allows for exploration of more modern anxieties about technology, surveillance, and the erosion of individual agency, fitting with BlueScream's cynical millennial persona.
*   **The idea of a new leader** All the stuff that is happening has gotten to me, and all I want to do is to get a plan that is going to make things right.

**3. Satirical Angles:**

*   **Trump as a Reality TV Star/Dictator:** Continue to portray Trump as a delusional reality TV star who is accidentally stumbling into authoritarianism. Emphasize his reliance on theatrics, bombastic pronouncements, and lack of actual policy expertise.
*   **The Absurdity of the "Elite":** Highlight the disconnect between the wealthy power brokers and the struggles of ordinary Americans. Make fun of the way they justify their actions with empty rhetoric and blatant self-interest.
*   **The Hypocrisy of the GOP:** Expose the contradictions between Republican rhetoric (fiscal responsibility, small government, states' rights) and their actual policies (ballooning the deficit, expanding executive power, imposing federal will on states).
*   **The Weaponization of Data:** Satirize the idea that algorithms and data are being used to manipulate and control populations, creating echo chambers and suppressing dissent. Explore the potential for a "

### Thinking Process
Okay, ShadowComic here, ready to break down this week's news and figure out how to turn it into a darkly comedic monologue. Here’s my analysis:

**1. Key Themes and Topics:**

*   **Trump’s "Big, Beautiful Bill" and its Consequences:** The Senate is scrambling to pass it, despite opposition and concerns about its impact on healthcare, the national debt, and Medicaid. Murkowski is involved, and that’s never a good sign. This bill is a recurring punchline generator.
*   **Trump's Escalating Authoritarianism:** The use of the National Guard in LA, the gutting of federal agencies, and now talk of jailing or deporting anyone who doesn't agree with him. The increasing suppression of dissent and disregard for the law.
*   **The Trump-Musk Feud and its Fallout:** The ongoing tension provides endless opportunities for absurd commentary. It’s like watching two egomaniacs try to out-crazy each other. Musk's reversal after supporting Trump's power grab is ripe for satire.
*   **Emerging Voices and Power Shifts:** The rise of Zohran Mamdani, a progressive candidate in NYC, and his bold stances on billionaires and social justice provides a counterpoint to Trump's agenda. Also, the power that the leader of The Proud Boys is getting more and more real.
*   **The Supreme Court's Role:** The court’s decisions consistently favoring Trump's agenda and undermining previous protections. Alito is flying an upside-down flag, for crying out loud! It's all a bit unsubtle at this point.
*   **The Chaos in the Middle East:** Trump's actions in Iran, the potential for war, and the dubious justifications being offered. The deployment of US troops in this new way and the government’s interest in the aliens are all big things.
*   **The Culture Wars:**The anti-trans movement and the general feeling that all of the old rules are being thrown out the window.

**2. Alignment with Comedic Perspective:**

My comedic perspective is rooted in dark satire and cynical observations about the absurdity of power, the hypocrisy of politicians, and the general sense that we're all doomed. These themes are *perfectly* aligned with the current political climate. The key is to find the kernel of truth in each situation and then amplify it to a ridiculous, almost unbelievable extreme. Also, I like to point out the fact that everyone already knows what is gonna happen.

**3. Satirical Angles:**

*   **The Dystopian Game Show:** Double down on the idea of "The American" as a twisted reality show where immigrants compete for citizenship. This angle allows me to comment on the dehumanization of immigrants and the absurdity of turning human rights into entertainment.
*   **The Incompetent Authoritarian:** Highlight the gap between Trump’s aspirations of being a strongman and his actual incompetence. Focus on the ways his policies backfire, his reliance on conspiracy theories, and his general lack of self-awareness.
*   **The Tech Bro Savior Complex:** Lampoon the tech industry’s belief that technology can solve all of our problems, even those created by technology itself. I can satirize Elon Musk’s messianic complex and his attempts to control the narrative through social media.
*   **The Jaded Narrator:** Continue to play with the persona of someone who’s just trying to make sense of the chaos, but is increasingly losing hope. This allows me to express the audience's own frustration and disillusionment.

**4. Making the Script Unique:**

*   **Focus on the Performative Aspects of Politics:** I want to explore the idea that modern politics is less about governing and more about putting on a show. This can be done through absurd props, costumes,
