**(Opening music fades, BlueScream strides onto the stage to roaring applause and whistles. He adjusts the mic, a mischievous glint in his eye.)**

Good evening, patriots and… well, *others*. It's BlueScream, and I'm here to remind you that yes, this is still happening. The year is 2025, and if you’re feeling a sense of déjà vu that’s probably because you’ve already lived this nightmare once, maybe twice, depending on your… stamina.

So, the Trump administration is back. Again. Think of it as the world's longest, most expensive, and least satisfying reboot. Like they brought back "Friends," but instead of coffee and witty banter, it's trade wars and… whatever it is he does with his hair.

And the thing is, folks, I’m not even surprised. At this point, I expect the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to show up at the next State of the Union, wearing MAGA hats and hawking NFTs.

You know, the first time around, we thought, "Okay, this is a novelty. A weird blip in the timeline." But now? Now it’s like that one uncle who keeps showing up at Thanksgiving, drunk and ranting about lizard people. You don't want him there, but you’ve accepted he’s part of the family… a deeply, profoundly embarrassing part of the family.

And what's even more terrifying is the level of… normalcy. People are just… shrugging. Like, “Yeah, okay, another day, another executive order declaring war on… pronouns.” We've become desensitized to the absurd. We're like frogs slowly boiling in a pot of orange-tinted water.

Speaking of which, the new Secretary of Education just announced that climate change is “a liberal hoax perpetrated by Big Globe.” Big Globe! Apparently, the Illuminati outsourced their conspiracy theories to a toddler. And the best part? She was confirmed by a unanimous vote in the Senate. Bipartisanship! It's alive and well, folks, just… pointed directly at the sanity of the planet.

But hey, on the bright side, at least we're tackling the important issues. I saw on Fox News this morning that they're really concerned about the new M&M characters being too "woke." Apparently, the green M&M wearing sneakers is a clear sign of the downfall of Western civilization. I mean, I get it. We can't have our candy getting too uppity. Next thing you know, they'll be demanding equal pay and healthcare.

And the economy? Oh, the economy is booming! For… someone. I'm not entirely sure who, but I'm assuming it's the same people who own all the yachts and private islands. The rest of us are just… participating. Like hamsters on a very expensive, very stressful wheel.

But don't worry, the administration has a plan to fix it! They're cutting taxes for the wealthy. Again. Because, you know, that's *totally* worked in the past. It’s like trying to fix a leaky faucet by turning the water on full blast.

And the Supreme Court? Don't even get me started. They're so conservative, they make Phyllis Schlafly look like a radical feminist. I wouldn't be surprised if they started hearing cases on whether or not women should be allowed to own property.

You know, I was talking to my therapist the other day, and I said, "Doc, I'm starting to think that maybe this is all just a simulation. That we're living in some kind of bizarre, hyper-realistic video game designed to test the limits of human endurance."

And he said, "That'll be $300."

So, I guess it's not a simulation. It's just… real life. And real life is… well, it's something.

But you know what? I'm not giving up. I refuse to let the absurdity win. Because if we stop laughing, if we stop pointing out the madness, then they win. They want us to be complacent. They want us to just accept this as the new normal.

And I say, "No way."

We're not going to let them turn America into some kind of dystopian reality show. We're not going to let them destroy the planet for a few extra tax breaks. And we're definitely not going to let them tell us that green M&Ms in sneakers are a threat to democracy.

So, let's keep laughing. Let's keep fighting. Let's keep reminding them that we're not going anywhere.

Because this is our country. And we're not going to let them take it away from us.
