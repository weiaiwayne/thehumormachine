**BlueScream:** Welcome back, folks, to another edition of “Burning Bridges and Salting the Earth,” the only show that promises to leave you more cynical than when you arrived. Tonight, we’re diving headfirst into the dumpster fire of democracy, because apparently, our elected officials decided to hold a competition to see who could set the most questionable policy ablaze.

First up, let’s talk about the economy. Remember that trickle-down theory we all laughed at in the ‘80s? Well, it’s back! Apparently, it's been renamed "Supply-Side Jesus," and it's still not feeding the masses. I swear, if I hear one more economist tell me that tax cuts for billionaires are going to magically solve inflation, I'm going to personally redistribute their wealth...by buying a yacht.

Speaking of inflation, have you noticed how everything is more expensive? Eggs are suddenly a luxury item, gas prices fluctuate more wildly than my ex’s mood swings, and don’t even get me started on the cost of avocado toast. Apparently, millennials are single-handedly destroying the economy by…checks notes…eating healthy food. I guess we should all just go back to consuming solely ramen noodles and regret. That'll fix everything.

And then there's the housing market. Apparently, the only way to afford a house these days is to inherit one from your great-aunt Mildred, who mysteriously vanished during a yacht trip in 1987. And even then, you'll probably be outbid by some shell corporation owned by a Cayman Islands trust fund. The American Dream? More like the American Nightmare, starring crippling debt and existential dread.

But hey, at least we have…checks notes again…space tourism! Yes, that's right, while the rest of us are struggling to afford groceries, billionaires are launching themselves into orbit for a ten-minute joyride. I mean, sure, solving world hunger or climate change might be a *slightly* better use of resources, but who needs clean water when you can have a selfie in zero gravity? It's the new escapism: escape Earth's problems, literally.

And don't even get me started on the culture wars. Apparently, we're still arguing about books. Books! In the age of TikTok dances and AI-generated art, we're banning books because…they might make kids think? God forbid children develop critical thinking skills. Let's just stick to the classics, like "Goosebumps" and corporate propaganda disguised as educational materials.

And speaking of propaganda, let's talk about social media. It's a cesspool of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and influencers hawking detox teas that are probably just glorified laxatives. But hey, at least it's a great way to stay connected with your relatives who think the earth is flat and vaccines cause autism. Family gatherings have never been more…enlightening.

But perhaps the most absurd thing of all is the state of our political discourse. We're so polarized that we can't even agree on basic facts. It's like living in a parallel universe where up is down, black is white, and common sense is a rare and endangered species. And the politicians? They're just fueling the fire, pandering to their bases and scoring cheap political points while the country slowly crumbles around them.

I saw a post today that said, "America is a two-party system: one party is evil, the other is incompetent." I think that's overly generous. It's more like: one party is actively trying to dismantle democracy, the other is politely asking them to stop while simultaneously offering them tax breaks.

But hey, at least we have…checks notes AGAIN…thoughts and prayers! Yes, after every mass shooting, every natural disaster, every senseless tragedy, we offer our thoughts and prayers. Because apparently, thoughts and prayers are more effective than gun control, disaster relief, or any actual meaningful action. It's the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card for politicians who are too cowardly to address the real issues.

So, what's the solution? I don't know. I'm a comedian, not a miracle worker. But maybe, just maybe, if we all stopped taking everything so seriously and started laughing at the absurdity of it all, we might actually be able to find some common ground. Or at least, we'd have a good laugh before the world ends. And let's be honest, that's probably the best we can hope for at
