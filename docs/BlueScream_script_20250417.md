**(Opening sequence: Fast cuts of Trump rallies, Fox News headlines, oil slicks, and then a title card that reads: “BlueScream: Still Here, Still Screaming”)**

**(BlueScream walks onto the stage, takes a sip of water, and surveys the audience with a weary smile.)**

Alright, alright settle down folks, you’re giving me flashbacks to that time I accidentally wandered into a mime convention. Except, you know, louder.

So, here we are. 2025. And if you're even remotely surprised that we're still talking about *him*, you clearly haven’t learned a damn thing about how this country operates. It's like the Energizer bunny, except instead of selling batteries, it's selling… well, let’s just call it “alternative facts.”

**(Beat. BlueScream gestures vaguely.)**

Four more years, people. Four more years of… whatever *this* is. I’ve officially stopped calling it a “presidency.” It's more like an extended performance art piece. A really, really bad one. Like, “Cats” level bad. And I'm not talking about the broadway show, I'm talking about the Tom Hooper adaptation.

**(BlueScream shudders.)**

Speaking of things that should be buried and forgotten, remember that whole “infrastructure week” thing? Yeah, me neither. But fear not! This time, it’s different! This time, we’re building a *moon base*. Yes, a moon base. Because apparently, Earth's problems are too boring. We need to pollute space now, too. It's like moving to a new house just to trash it faster.

And the best part? It's being spearheaded by a consortium of tech bros who think putting a dome on the moon is the same as solving income inequality. One of them even suggested mining lunar cheese to solve world hunger. I swear, I'm not making this up. Although, if I *was* going to make something up, it would be slightly less insane.

**(BlueScream leans into the mic.)**

Meanwhile, back on Planet Reality, things are… well, they're reliably terrible. The Supreme Court has declared that oxygen is optional, as long as you’re contributing to the GDP. Just kidding. Mostly. But they *did* rule that corporations have the right to sue you for hurting their feelings. And by "hurting their feelings," I mean "criticizing their business practices." So, watch what you tweet, folks. Big Oil has a good cry and suddenly you owe them your house.

**(BlueScream throws his hands up in mock despair.)**

And the climate? Oh, the climate. We’re now officially experiencing “unprecedented weather events.” Which is code for “everything’s on fire, underwater, or both.” The Great Lakes are now the Great Puddles, and Miami is the Atlantis of our time. But hey, at least we have that moon base to escape to when the whole thing goes belly up. Assuming, of course, you can afford the ticket. And the oxygen.

**(Beat. BlueScream sighs dramatically.)**

The only good news is that political satire is basically writing itself these days. I just need to transcribe the news and add a few well-placed pauses. The problem is, I’m starting to feel like a court jester in the court of madness. Like, I’m making jokes about the apocalypse, and the audience is politely chuckling along, as if we’re just discussing the weather. Which, ironically, we are.

**(BlueScream walks to the edge of the stage.)**

But here’s the thing. I refuse to normalize this. I refuse to accept that this is just “the new normal.” Because the new normal is a dumpster fire wearing a toupee. And we can’t let that dumpster fire dictate the terms of our existence.

**(BlueScream’s voice turns serious for a moment.)**

So, what do we do? Well, first, we stop doomscrolling. Seriously, put down your phones. Go outside. Touch grass. Remember what the sun feels like before it fries us all to a crisp.

Then, we get organized. We find common ground. We talk to people who don’t agree with us. And we vote. Like our lives depend on it. Because, let's be honest, they kind of do.

**(BlueScream returns to his lighter tone.)**

And in the meantime, I'll be here, screaming into the void. Because someone has to. And because, frankly, it’s cheaper than therapy.

**(BlueScream winks.)**

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go practice my lunar cheese mining techniques. You know, just
