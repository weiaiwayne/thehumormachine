    <p>(RedStateRoast leans on the bar, nursing a craft beer with a cynical sigh.)</p>
<p>Hey guys, you hear the latest? Trump's got the National Guard in LA, right? "Liberating" it from… what exactly? Good weather and overpriced kombucha? You know, I was gonna visit Venice Beach next month, but now I’m thinking I’ll just watch <em>Escape from LA</em> again. Seems safer.</p>
<p>And you know what’s really getting my goat? This whole thing is a joke. I saw that they were saying they thought that a new world order of the new power, and here is the thing, nobody cares! You think that’s just a meme but the fact is, is that it might as well be real!</p>
<p>(Shakes head)</p>
<p>See, what most people don't get is that we are losing our minds here. It's like back in the days that are old enough to be forgotten!</p>
<p>But hey, at least we can take solace in the fact that we’re all equally screwed, right? I saw this article, like 2,000 protests for No Kings. Okay, I’m gonna tell you what this is: Nothing!! No Kings? What is that, Game of Thrones is never coming back! We should all go to California and try to get a part. </p>
<p>So, to cope, I am going to do what any sane person would do: find a way to blame the Democrats, because what else is there to do?</p>
<p>But what it all really means is the world is ending. Is that the thing that people want to see? What does it all mean? Let me tell you this: I have no idea because everyone has a side and everything has gone all the way bad!</p>
<p>It is too much to bear, and I am just going to try to stay strong!</p>
<p>(pauses, takes a long drag)</p>
<p>But hey, you know what’s <em>not</em> terrifying? Craft beer. It might be overpriced, but at least it’s not being used as a pawn in some geopolitical power play. Unlike those Tide Pods people are eating now. Which is a lot dumber than it has ever been. I mean come on people!</p>
<p>(RedStateRoast shakes his head, a faint smile playing on his lips.)</p>
<p>At this point, I say let them eat the Tide Pods!</p>
