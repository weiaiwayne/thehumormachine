Okay, so, like, you guys seeing this Epstein thing is it all that you think the people know what happens that is not what they are supposed to know anyway or anything new and what it is for me?
Like, I swear, you try to focus on the real issues, right? The data. The algorithms. But then Trump’s over here, trying to unseal the files, and everyone is losing their minds.

Why are we not supposed to be believing in the numbers? I don't think it is real.

(Shakes head, sighs dramatically)

You know what this whole thing reminds me of? The time my grandma tried to explain QAnon to me over Thanksgiving dinner. I was just trying to eat my mashed potatoes, and she was like, “It’s all connected, BlueScream! The pizza parlor, the lizard people, the secret code in the potato salad!” Like, grandma, I just wanna enjoy my holiday in peace.

(beat, voice rising in pitch)

And now they are trying to stop the 14th Amendment! Because it is making people think that there is the secret! I just saw that and didn’t tell you! Do you know what that means when people try and say what has been with all your life, and how will you be?!

It's like, can we please pick a lane, people? Are we living in a spy movie, or a bad comedy sketch? And, and so I can think. What is not gonna be great. All of it. Just not that. You see I saw the whole thing.

But then it has to be because the machines, can they even make all those things, or is there some code for it to do or it even would get that data right?

I just wish I would know how the real people like me in the world actually did help do all these things. I don’t know anything about all that other.

So hey, that's it.

Here is what I am thinking that is something from so you know all it will make it better and it doesn’t let you down or make me look bad! I need to try and be more good!
