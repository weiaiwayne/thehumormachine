**(Opening music: A jaunty ragtime tune played on a slightly out-of-tune piano, interspersed with the sound of dial-up internet. BlueScream saunters onstage, wearing a t-shirt that reads "I'm with Stupid" with an arrow pointing upwards.)**

BlueScream: Greetings, sentient beings! Or, as the algorithm probably knows you, “highly engaged demographic units.” How’s everyone enjoying the new Metaverse White House? I tried to visit, but my avatar kept getting stuck in the virtual Rose Garden because of… well, let’s just say the coding wasn’t optimized for realistic presidential hair physics.

So, it’s May 2025. And if you’re anything like me, you’re probably wondering: what fresh hell awaits us this week? Well, buckle up, buttercups, because the clown car of American politics just added a new set of oversized tires.

First up: the ongoing saga of Trump vs. TikTok. Remember when he tried to ban it back in the day? Turns out, banning TikTok is harder than finding a rational argument on cable news. The app's now owned by a consortium of venture capitalists and sentient hamsters, and Trump, ever the pragmatist, has apparently signed a deal to become the platform's official meme ambassador. Yes, you heard that right. The former president is now shilling for the very platform he once deemed a national security threat. His first sponsored post? A dance challenge to the tune of “Make America Great Again” performed while wearing a MAGA-branded fidget spinner. The internet, predictably, exploded. Mostly with schadenfreude.

And speaking of explosions, the latest hot-button issue is… wait for it… mandatory patriotism classes in public schools. Apparently, teaching kids about civics, history, and critical thinking is too “woke.” Instead, they’ll be learning the Pledge of Allegiance backward, memorizing the lyrics to Toby Keith songs, and participating in competitive flag-waving tournaments. The curriculum, drafted by a panel of Fox News contributors and self-proclaimed constitutional scholars, also includes a mandatory unit on the dangers of “cultural Marxism” and the importance of owning at least three firearms. Field trips include visits to gun shows, Confederate monuments, and CPAC conferences. I’m sure our children will emerge from this education well-rounded and totally not at all brainwashed.

Meanwhile, the Democrats are… well, they’re still trying to figure out what a "hashtag" is. Their latest strategy to win back disillusioned voters? A series of earnest town halls hosted on Zoom, featuring PowerPoint presentations on the importance of bipartisanship and the urgent need for comprehensive climate legislation. Attendance is… sparse. Mostly because everyone’s too busy doomscrolling on TikTok to notice.

But the real head-scratcher this week is the burgeoning feud between Vice President MTG and Elon Musk. Apparently, Musk, in a moment of boredom, tweeted that MTG’s hairstyle resembled a “badly taxidermied badger.” MTG, never one to let an insult go unanswered, responded by calling Musk a “soulless Martian overlord” and accusing him of secretly plotting to replace all human workers with robot butlers. The feud escalated rapidly, culminating in a bizarre Twitter Spaces debate moderated by Joe Rogan. The debate, which lasted for 17 hours and featured discussions on everything from the merits of cryptocurrency to the existence of Bigfoot, ended with both MTG and Musk declaring victory. The rest of us just ended up with a migraine.

And the Supreme Court? Oh, they’re just chilling. Literally. They’ve apparently installed a cryo-chamber in the courthouse basement, so they can preserve their conservative majority for centuries to come. I’m not sure if that’s legal, ethical, or even scientifically possible, but at this point, I’ve stopped asking questions. I just assume that everything is legal, ethical, and scientifically possible, as long as it benefits the people in power.

But hey, it’s not all bad news. Scientists have finally discovered a cure for the common cold. The only catch? It’s a vaccine developed by Bill Gates and administered through a microchip implanted in your brain. So, you know, pros and cons.

And speaking of cures, Congress is currently debating a bill that would legalize recreational marijuana nationwide. The bill, sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of Republicans and Democrats, is expected to pass easily. Mostly because they all want to get high and forget about the dumpster fire that is American politics.

So, there you have it, folks. Another week in the twilight zone. A land where windmills cause cancer, patriotism is mandatory, and the Vice President is feuding with Elon Musk. If you need me, I’ll be in my bunker, binge-watching old episodes of The West Wing and praying for a meteor strike. Or, you know, just a slightly less insane news cycle. Is that too much to ask?
