(Lights up on ShadowComic, perched on a stool, a single spotlight illuminating him. He wears a slightly rumpled suit, a tie askew. He sips from a suspiciously opaque mug.)

Good evening, patriots. Or, as we’re now legally obligated to call you, ‘Compliant Citizens of the Glorious American Reclamation Project, v. 2.0’. It’s good to be back, broadcasting from… well, let’s just say a ‘location of strategic anonymity’. Think of it as the journalistic equivalent of witness protection, only instead of gangsters, we’re hiding from… well, you know.

(He takes another sip from the mug, wincing slightly.)

Decaf. They spiked the coffee again. Probably thinks it’ll make me more… enthusiastic about the latest executive order. You know, the one where they re-classified irony as a ‘weapon of mass dissent’? Apparently, my last monologue constituted a ‘clear and present danger to the national… narrative’.

Speaking of narratives, I see our esteemed President, bless his perpetually sun-kissed soul, has unveiled his new infrastructure plan. He’s calling it “Operation: Golden Arches.” And no, it’s not about fixing the potholes. It’s about building a solid gold replica of the White House, brick by gilded brick, on the moon. He claims it’s crucial for “intergalactic diplomacy,” but I suspect it’s more about having a really, really shiny summer home.

The price tag? A mere $7 trillion. Don’t worry, though. He assured us it’ll be fully funded by selling off Yosemite National Park to a consortium of Saudi oil barons. Apparently, they’re planning to turn Half Dome into a giant, rotating hookah. Think of it as eco-tourism, but with more… ambiance.

And while we’re on the topic of environmental stewardship, remember that pesky Endangered Species Act? Well, it’s gone. Extinct, you might say. Replaced by the “American Opportunity Act for Aggressively Profitable Fauna.” Which, as I understand it, allows you to hunt any animal that’s deemed ‘economically inefficient.’ So, goodbye bald eagles, hello… well, I’m not sure what’s profitable about pandas, but I’m sure someone will figure it out. Maybe panda-skin phone cases?

The Supreme Court, of course, unanimously upheld the Act. Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurring opinion, declared it “totally awesome,” and then reportedly shotgunned a Bud Light on the courthouse steps. Sources say he later challenged a pigeon to a beer pong match.

But hey, it’s not all bad news. The Department of Education has announced a groundbreaking new curriculum focused on “Presidential Self-Esteem Enhancement.” Every student, from kindergarten to college, will be required to write a daily haiku praising the President’s hair. Failure to comply will result in mandatory re-education at the "Trump University School of Advanced Reality." I hear their graduation rate is… impressive.

And in the realm of international relations, things are, shall we say, dynamic. The President has brokered a historic peace treaty between North Korea and… Cleveland. Apparently, Kim Jong-un really likes pierogies. As part of the agreement, Cleveland is now officially designated a “Nuclear-Free Zone of Cultural Pierogi Exchange.” Which, frankly, is the most Cleveland thing I’ve ever heard.

Meanwhile, relations with Europe have soured. The President, after accidentally declaring war on Luxembourg during a particularly heated Twitter rant, has imposed crippling tariffs on all European cheese. He claims it’s a matter of national security, citing “evidence” that brie is a communist plot.

The only country that seems to be thriving is… Russia. Go figure. They’ve just unveiled their new “Democracy Delivery Drone” program, which will air-drop ballot boxes directly into American homes. Don’t worry, they’re tamper-proof. Probably.

(He pauses, takes another sip from his mug, and sighs.)

You know, sometimes I miss the good old days. When political satire was just… satire. Now, it feels more like a slightly delayed news report. I mean, honestly, at this point, I’m half-expecting to wake up tomorrow and find out that the President has declared himself Emperor, and the national anthem has been replaced with a polka version of “Born in the USA.”

(He looks directly into the camera, a flicker of defiance in his eyes.)

But here’s the thing, folks. They can spike my coffee, they can re-classify irony, they can even build a solid gold White House on the moon. But they can’t take away our… well, they can’t take away our… damn, what was I going to say?

(He fumbles for a moment, then shrugs.)

Never mind
