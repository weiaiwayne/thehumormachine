Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. I know, I know, seeing a red hat makes you reach for your fainting couch. But tonight, we’re not triggered, we’re informed. Or at least, we're going to *try* to be.

So, another week, another dumpster fire barely averted by the sheer force of Trump’s unwavering… charisma. Let’s dive in, shall we?

First up, the economy. Remember when Biden promised to build back better? Well, he built back… something. I'm not sure what it is, but it smells like inflation and tastes like regret. Luckily, the President has a plan. And by plan, I mean he's blaming Obama. Again. It's a classic, like a fine wine that's gone sour but you still drink it because you paid too much for it.

Speaking of paying too much for things, gas prices are through the roof. They’re so high, I saw a Prius driver filling up with premium. The shame. The absolute, unadulterated shame. But hey, at least we’re energy independent… from Saudi Arabia. Baby steps, folks, baby steps.

Now, let's talk about the border. Remember that wall? The beautiful, big, beautiful wall? Well, it’s still under construction. Think of it as a metaphor for the American dream: perpetually unfinished and plagued by bureaucratic red tape. But don’t worry, the President assures us it'll be done soon. Right after Mexico pays for it. Any day now. I'm holding my breath, but I'm also investing in oxygen tanks. Just in case.

On the topic of walls, I heard that Nancy Pelosi is building one around her vineyard. To keep out… Republicans? Common sense? The truth? Who knows. All I know is that if you’re going to preach about open borders, maybe don’t build a literal wall around your own personal sanctuary. Just a thought.

And what about our brave men and women in uniform? Well, the woke military is still trying to figure out what pronouns to use while simultaneously repelling a hypothetical Chinese invasion. Good luck with that, fellas. Meanwhile, Russia's doing… something. I’m not entirely sure what, and frankly, I’m too afraid to ask. Let's just say Putin is still shirtless, still riding horses, and still making Biden look like he's trying to parallel park a shopping cart.

The culture wars are raging, of course. They never really stop, do they? It's like a never-ending episode of reality TV, except instead of fake tans and botox, it's pronouns and critical race theory. But hey, at least it keeps us distracted from the impending economic collapse. Silver linings, people.

I saw a headline the other day that said "Gen Z Cancels Shakespeare." Shakespeare! The guy wrote Hamlet. He invented half the insults we use today. But apparently, he's problematic now. I guess because he didn't include enough non-binary characters in *Romeo and Juliet*. I’m starting to think the only thing that will unite this country is a zombie apocalypse. Because even the woke crowd will have to admit that brains are delicious, regardless of gender identity.

Speaking of gender identity, the Supreme Court is still trying to figure out what a woman is. I'm not even going to touch that one. It's like trying to defuse a bomb while blindfolded and juggling chainsaws. Just… no.

And then there’s the media. CNN is still trying to figure out how to be relevant without Trump. It's like watching a toddler trying to ride a bike after someone stole the wheels. Bless their hearts. MSNBC is still blaming everything on Russia. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if they blamed Putin for my dry cleaning bill.

Fox News, on the other hand, is doing what it always does: yelling about liberals and selling gold. It’s a winning formula. Can’t argue with success.

But let's be honest, folks. We're all just trying to survive in this crazy, mixed-up world. We're all just trying to make sense of the chaos. And sometimes, the only way to do that is to laugh. Even if it's a slightly bitter, slightly cynical, slightly deranged laugh.

So, here's to another week of political absurdity. Here's to another week of outrage and indignation. And here's to another week of me making fun of it all. Because let's face it, someone has to.
