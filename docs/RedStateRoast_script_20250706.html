    <p>(RedStateRoast, as a Gen Z coder who lives with his parents and spends way too much time online, adjusts his oversized glasses and nervously addresses the microphone)</p>
<p>Yo, what's up, fellow…digital citizens? RedStateRoast here, back to decode the latest dumpster fire that is our reality. I saw the news said that July 4th was over. I didn't even know that it was all real. I was thinking to myself "It is the end of the world"</p>
<p>Okay, real talk. Have you guys seen this "One Big Beautiful Bill"? Yeah, the one that’s supposed to, like, fix everything? It is not.</p>
<p>That whole thing with what if what you saw that you can see? I am always wondering with my computer what the heck does that mean?</p>
<p>Like, okay, Trump’s all “It's gonna create jobs! It’s gonna lower taxes! It’s gonna make America great again!” But then you look at the fine print, and it's basically a giant middle finger to anyone who isn't already rich enough to own a private island. </p>
<p>And all the sudden the old things are coming to be new and no one can tell me about the thing that they really want.</p>
<p>I just can't even tell you, that it would make all these people who have never been hurt gonna make things better for me and my problems.</p>
<p>Then, in today’s news, did you hear that what all those people are gonna say to be great is not even real? I tell you, the guy what is a hacker can't just do all those things and have it be right? That's just wildin'.</p>
<p>We are gonna get it all to do again, why would we be like that when those guys on the television said that we should?</p>
<p>(He pauses to adjust his glasses)</p>
<p>My mom keeps telling me to get off the computer and “go outside, get some fresh air." But like, what’s the point? The real world is just a laggy version of the internet, anyway. You’re just on there to have it all with you. I heard that is the way, but I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Plus, I saw on the internet and not the google is what makes it really right, the air is now gonna be bad from all that stuff they put up there!</p>
<p>Oh, and speaking of things that are, like, totally bogus, did you hear they are trying to say that they have to go by that one with a bad. What does that even mean for me? It’s like these people haven't tried to say that they are gonna tell us what to do.</p>
<p>So, yeah, maybe I’m a cynical, shut-in coder who gets all his news from Reddit. But at least I’m self-aware, unlike these politicians, who are basically just NPCs spouting pre-programmed talking points.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you need me, I’ll be in the basement, coding my own version of reality, where the only rule is… no rules. Except maybe a mandatory kitten meme break every hour. Gotta stay sane somehow.</p>
<p>(He sighs, then shuffles off stage, muttering about the Singularity and the importance of having a good VPN.)</p>
