## ShadowComic: State of the Union…Again?

(Lights up on ShadowComic, leaning casually against a faux-marble pillar, a single spotlight illuminating their face. They adjust their glasses, a sardonic smile playing on their lips.)

So, America. We meet again. Feels like just yesterday I was ranting about…well, the exact same things, doesn’t it? Except now my therapist charges double for the "Trump Trauma 2.0" package. Apparently, the market dictates the price of existential dread. Capitalism, everybody!

I gotta hand it to him, though. Trump’s a master illusionist. He made us all think the last four years were a fever dream. A bad batch of freedom fries. Turns out, it was just a commercial break. And now we’re back to the regularly scheduled programming: reality TV disguised as democracy.

Remember when we thought "alternative facts" were the peak of absurdity? Oh, honey, we were so naive. Now we're living in a post-fact world. Facts are just…suggestions. Like wearing pants to work. Technically, it's a rule, but who's really enforcing it? I saw a guy in a Speedo at the grocery store yesterday. Said it was his "patriotic duty" to show off his freedom.

And speaking of duty, the Supreme Court is now just a rubber stamp factory. They’re churning out decisions faster than Amazon churns out cardboard boxes. Roe v. Wade? Gone. Affirmative action? History. Separation of church and state? More like a mild suggestion. At this rate, they'll be legalizing duels by next Tuesday. I’m already practicing my pistol draw. Just in case.

The midterm elections were…interesting. The Red Wave turned into a Red Trickle. Apparently, even gerrymandering can't overcome sheer, unadulterated apathy. Though, you gotta give it to the Republicans. They managed to convince enough people that voting machines were rigged, even though they were the ones rigging them. It's like watching a magician saw himself in half and then blame the audience for the inconvenience.

And the economy? Booming! For the top 0.01%, anyway. The rest of us are just trying to figure out how to afford gas and ramen at the same time. Inflation is so high, my grocery bill now qualifies for its own stimulus check. I’m thinking of starting a GoFundMe just to buy avocados. "Help ShadowComic Afford Guacamole: A Plea for Humanity."

But hey, at least we’re energy independent! Thanks to good ol’ fossil fuels. Never mind the polar ice caps melting faster than my sanity. Who needs penguins when you have cheap gas? Besides, Trump promises to build a wall around Florida to keep the rising sea levels out. Genius, right? I heard he’s taking bids from contractors. The wall will be made of the finest…golf courses.

And foreign policy? Oh, don't even get me started. We’re best friends with Russia again. Apparently, all it took was a strongly worded tweet and a few strategically placed rubles. China is our new arch-nemesis, even though most of our stuff is made there. It's like arguing with your landlord while wearing his clothes.

North Korea is still…North Korea. Kim Jong-un and Trump are back to exchanging love letters. I bet those letters are just filled with pictures of missiles and bad hair days. It’s the world’s most awkward bromance.

The media, of course, is thriving. Fear sells, baby! Every cable news channel is now just a 24/7 Trump rally. They’re arguing about whether he's the second coming or the antichrist. Nobody seems to remember that he’s just a grumpy old man with a Twitter addiction and a really bad spray tan.

And the Democrats? Well, they’re…trying. They’re trying really hard. They’re holding town halls, writing op-eds, and generally wringing their hands in despair. They’re like that kid in class who always raises their hand but never has the right answer. bless their hearts.

The only good news is that marijuana is finally legal nationwide. Thank God for small mercies. At least we can all get high and pretend that everything is fine. Which, let’s be honest, is the only way to survive the next four years.

So, what have we learned? We've learned that history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes. We've learned that democracy is fragile. And we’ve learned that orange really *isn't* a good look on anyone.

(ShadowComic pauses, looks directly into the camera, a flicker of defiance in their eyes.)

But here's the thing. I'm not giving up. I'm not going anywhere. They
