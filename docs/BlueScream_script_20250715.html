    <p>(sound of ice clinking in a glass, a long sigh)</p>
<p>Okay, so, you guys seeing this thing with Trump threatening tariffs on BRICS nations? Like, BRICS? I swear, it sounds like a rejected breakfast cereal from the 80s. "Part of this balanced breakfast brought to you by BRICS! Now with 10% more global economic instability!"</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>And the reason he's doing it is if these countries don’t align with the US? Is it like they don’t have enough gold already? It reminds me of this time, I swear, when my landlord tried to raise my rent because he said he needed to make renovations. What renovations? He put gold trim on the toilet. I moved out the second my lease was done.</p>
<p>It’s all just so… arbitrary, right? Like, you can make tariffs? I mean if the President wants to start having these things, what’s stopping him?</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>You know what that just really gets to me? The way that these rules have all just let you play by those rules when it's all working, right?</p>
<p>I read that some of Trump’s followers are trying to start a new way to do it! What I think is that we all just live in a new city, it's like they’re building a new civilization so we could all be ready to go and it's always there!</p>
<p>We may as well just do what’s great because all that has got is you out of the door!</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>But hey, here’s the real kicker, so the Supreme Court is now letting Trump gut the Education Department! You know, because apparently, being well-informed is a threat to national security now. It’s like they’re deliberately trying to turn us all into… sentient conspiracy theory generators. </p>
<p>I'm starting to believe my grandma!</p>
<p>(Leans into the mic conspiratorially)</p>
<p>That's just what I'm saying! It's all a great plan by the government to make sure that they are right about it!</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m gonna go try to think about all this while being in bed with the lights turned out. Is that just gonna be what happens?</p>
<p>(Shrugs)</p>
<p>Anyway, you guys want another round? I’m buying… with the money I definitely got from a bunch of people doing what they do! Now I'm gonna go get in my plane because I don't wanna talk about it anymore.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is vote for me, in 2028. That is something you gotta know!
It's a wrap!</p>
