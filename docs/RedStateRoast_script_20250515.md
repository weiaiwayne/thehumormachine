Evening, patriots! Or, as they say in Portland, "Good Evening, Comrades! Please remember to compost your anxieties."

Another beautiful day in Trump's America. And by beautiful, I mean terrifyingly beautiful. Like a sunset over a nuclear test site. Speaking of which, did you see Biden’s latest interview? He looked like he was trying to remember the name of his cat. The cat died in 1987. He’s a walking, talking, gaffe-generating testament to the wonders of modern medicine. Bless his heart. And get him a teleprompter with REALLY big font.

The Times is doing live coverage of Trump's presidency? Live coverage? That’s like live coverage of a Category 5 hurricane. You know it's going to be a wild ride, you know you should probably evacuate, but you're also secretly morbidly curious about what happens when a Taco Bell gets swept away.

And The Independent is reporting that a Mexican governor says Trump revoked her tourist visa. Revoked! I love it. Turns out "build the wall" wasn’t just a metaphor. It's now a personalized border control strategy. I picture Trump sitting at his desk, flipping through passport photos, muttering, "Nope, nope, definitely not... ah, there's one! Denied! For crimes against American taste buds – that cilantro abomination you call salsa? Unforgivable.”

Meanwhile, the Democrats are still searching for their own… well, anything resembling a cohesive strategy. It's like watching a bunch of squirrels trying to assemble an IKEA bookshelf. Lots of frantic activity, plenty of squeaking, but ultimately ending up with a pile of mismatched parts and a gnawed instruction manual. They're pinning their hopes on Gavin Newsom, I hear. Gavin Newsom! The man who makes even Nancy Pelosi look like a fiscal conservative. He’s so slick, he probably oils his hair with unicorn tears.

I saw a Reddit post the other day comparing Trump to a reality TV star. Well, duh! He IS a reality TV star. Except instead of fighting over cake decorating, he’s fighting over, you know, the future of Western civilization. Same difference, really. Less frosting, more existential dread.

And the AP is keeping us updated on all the political news. Bless their hearts. They’re still trying to figure out if Trump's hair is real. Guys, it's 2025. We have self-driving cars and lab-grown meat. Can't we figure out if a toupee is glued to a billionaire's head? Priorities!

I read some comments online saying Trump is going to run for a third term. Settle down, folks. We're not Venezuela yet. Although, the way things are going with the price of gas, maybe we should start looking into nationalizing our oil reserves. Just kidding! (Mostly.)

The other day I saw a protest outside the White House. Signs everywhere. “Resist!” “Impeach!” “Free Britney!” Wait, what? Is she still a thing? Look, I get it. Everyone's got their own cause. But maybe focus on the whole "saving democracy" thing before you start demanding justice for a pop star who hasn't released an album since 2016.

Speaking of protests, I saw one where they were burning MAGA hats. Burning hats? Is that the best you’ve got? I mean, come on! At least try to be creative. Burn a Bernie Sanders doll dressed as a communist leprechaun. Now THAT'S entertainment.

I’m starting to think that the only way to make sense of American politics these days is to embrace the absurdity of it all. Just throw your hands up, laugh maniacally, and accept that we’re all living in a real-life episode of *The Twilight Zone*, written by a committee of chimpanzees on meth.

I saw a poll the other day that said Trump's approval rating is at 42%. Forty-two percent! That's practically a mandate. Either that, or 42% of Americans are legally insane. I'm going with the latter.

And the media? Don't even get me started. They're still clutching their pearls over everything Trump says. It's like watching a bunch of Victorian ladies faint at the sight of a bare ankle. Get over it, people! He's been saying crazy stuff for decades. If you're still shocked, you haven't been paying attention.

So, what's next? World War III? Alien invasion? Another season of *The Real Housewives of D.C.*? At this point, anything is possible. Buckle up, folks. It's going to be a bumpy ride. And don't forget to compost your anxieties.
