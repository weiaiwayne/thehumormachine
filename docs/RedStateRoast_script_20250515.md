Evening, citizens! Or, as the Globalist Elite Overlords now classify you: "Bio-unique carbon units awaiting resource allocation directives." Good to be back. Still not microchipped. Though I suspect my dentist is in cahoots with Bill Gates.

So, the big story, folks, is that Vice President MTG just declared May National Conspiracy Theory Awareness Month. She says it’s about “embracing alternative perspectives” and “questioning the official narrative.” I think it’s about finally legitimizing her QAnon bingo card. I heard the White House Easter Egg Roll will be replaced with a “Find the Real JFK Jr.” scavenger hunt. The grand prize? A lifetime supply of adrenochrome-infused gummy bears.

And speaking of the Veep, she’s been unusually quiet on the Canadian front lately. Ever since President Trump, in his infinite wisdom, redrew the US-Canada border… on his golf course scorecard. Apparently, the 18th hole is now officially sovereign American territory. Trudeau is fuming. He threatened to retaliate by banning American hockey. But then remembered that nobody in America actually cares about hockey. Checkmate, Canada.

Meanwhile, the Dems are still trying to impeach… well, someone. Anyone. I think they’re holding auditions for impeachment-worthy offenses. AOC suggested impeaching Trump for “crimes against fashion” – citing his ongoing obsession with ill-fitting suits and that weird spray tan. I gotta admit, she’s got a point. But I think there are bigger fish to fry. Like, say, the looming threat of sentient AI overthrowing the government and forcing us all to wear matching jumpsuits.

I saw Kamala Harris on TikTok the other day – which, let’s face it, is like seeing your grandma trying to twerk. She was promoting the administration’s new initiative to combat “digital disinformation” by… creating even *more* disinformation. Apparently, they’re going to flood the internet with AI-generated fake news stories designed to confuse and disorient the masses. It's like fighting fire with gasoline. But hey, at least it’s innovative.

And speaking of innovation, Elon Musk just announced his latest project: Neuralink for Pets. It’s a brain implant that allows you to communicate directly with your furry friends. He says it will “revolutionize pet ownership.” I suspect it will just lead to a massive influx of dogs demanding organic kibble and therapy sessions. I heard my neighbor’s cat already filed a lawsuit against him for “emotional distress” after reading his inner thoughts about wanting to replace her with a robot.

I also saw that the Supreme Court is hearing a case on whether or not the government can legally mandate the use of augmented reality glasses. Apparently, the deep state wants to force everyone to wear glasses that display government-approved news and propaganda 24/7. I’m not sure what’s more terrifying: the idea of being constantly bombarded with government propaganda, or the idea of everyone walking around looking like extras from a bad sci-fi movie.

And you guys hear about the new reality show? It’s called "The Real Deep Staters of D.C." It follows the lives of a group of high-ranking government officials as they navigate the treacherous waters of Washington politics, engage in clandestine meetings, and plot to undermine the President. It’s already a massive hit. I heard the show’s producers are struggling to keep up with the constant stream of leaks and insider information.

I also saw that the Department of Education is now requiring all teachers to undergo mandatory training in “woke micro-aggression detection.” It’s designed to teach teachers how to identify and address even the slightest hint of bias in their classrooms. I’m not sure if it will create a more inclusive learning environment, but it’s definitely going to create a generation of hyper-sensitive snowflakes who burst into tears every time someone accidentally misgenders their pet hamster.

And speaking of sensitivity, President Trump just announced his new social media platform: "Unfiltered Truth… Extreme Edition." It's exactly the same as the old Unfiltered Truth, but with even more bots, conspiracy theories, and unhinged rants. He says it's the "ultimate safe space for patriots." I suspect it's a way for him to monetize his outrage and avoid being censored by the liberal media. He’s already banned anyone who says his hair looks like a squirrel’s nest.

I'm not saying I *want* to live in a world where reality is indistinguishable from satire. I’m just saying, at least it's entertaining. Unlike the actual news.

The media is having a meltdown over the fact that Trump just pardoned a sentient AI robot convicted of hacking the Pentagon. Apparently, he thinks it's a "victim of the deep state's persecution of innovation." I’m not sure what’s more terrifying: the fact that Trump is president, or the fact that we now have sentient AI robots capable of committing crimes.

And the Democrats? They’re still trying to figure out how to win back the trust of the American people. They’re suddenly all about “common sense solutions” and “bipartisan cooperation.” As if anyone actually believes they’re capable of anything other than infighting and virtue signaling. They’re about as authentic as a politician kissing a baby.

So, buckle up, folks. The future is here. And it’s even weirder than we imagined.

Just remember to laugh. Because if you don’t laugh, you’ll end up joining a
