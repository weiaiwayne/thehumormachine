Evening, freedom-loving folks! Or, as the Ministry of Truth now refers to you: "Potential disruptors of the sanctioned narrative, pending psychological evaluation." Good to be back. Still haven’t been memory-holed. Yet.

So, the big buzz this week is Trump’s new campaign slogan: "Make America…Again-er." Apparently, the focus groups told him "Again" just wasn’t cutting it anymore. Needed that extra dollop of nostalgia. It's like he's trying to reboot the 80s, but instead of leg warmers and synth-pop, we get tariffs and Twitter rants at 3 AM. He also keeps trying to get people to say "Make America Great Again-est", but I'm not sure he understands what "est" means. I think it's a cry for help.

And speaking of incoherent rambling, Biden's been pretty quiet this week. Which, let's be honest, is a win for everyone. The White House is claiming he's "focusing on infrastructure." I suspect he's actually just trying to figure out how to use the self-checkout at Whole Foods. I heard he tried to pay for his prune juice with a rotary phone.

Meanwhile, the Democrats are still trying to decide who their next sacrificial lamb will be. AOC is rumored to be considering a run. Which would be…interesting. Imagine her debating Trump. It would be like watching a butterfly try to wrestle a grizzly bear on live television. A very articulate, social media savvy butterfly, but a butterfly nonetheless.

I saw that Kamala Harris is now the official spokesperson for the Metaverse. She's hosting virtual town halls in Second Life, trying to convince digital avatars to vote Democrat. I’m not sure who's more confused: her, or the avatars who still think it's 2007. I heard she tried to give a virtual hug to a pixelated libertarian who immediately filed a restraining order.

And speaking of technology, Elon Musk just unveiled his latest invention: the "De-Wokerizer 5000." It's a brain implant that instantly converts liberals into conservatives. He says it's a "public service." I suspect it's a marketing ploy to sell more Teslas to red states. The first test subject was Chris Hayes. The results were… inconclusive. He kept ranting about the Koch brothers, but now he also owns three guns and a pickup truck.

I also saw that the Supreme Court is hearing a case on whether or not corporations can be held liable for "emotional distress" caused by their advertising campaigns. Apparently, some millennials are suing Bud Light for giving them anxiety about their gender identity. I’m not sure how that works, but I’m pretty sure the real victim here is the American beer industry.

And you guys hear about the new Broadway musical? It's called "Hamilton: The MAGA Years." It's about Alexander Hamilton's secret love affair with Betsy Ross and his deep-seated hatred of immigrants. It's already sold out for the next five years. Lin-Manuel Miranda is reportedly considering moving to Canada.

I also saw that the Department of Education is now requiring all students to take a mandatory course on "Critical Race Theory for Dummies." It's designed to teach kids that everything is racist, even if they don't know why. The course culminates in a "privilege walk" where white students are forced to apologize for the sins of their ancestors. I’m not sure if it will solve racism, but it's definitely going to make Thanksgiving dinner awkward.

And speaking of awkward, Trump just announced his new social media platform: "Truth Social…Again-er." It's exactly the same as the old Truth Social, but with more bots and fewer users. He says it's the "last bastion of free speech." I suspect it's a way for him to keep tweeting without getting fact-checked by Twitter. He's already banned anyone who criticizes his toupee.

I'm not saying I *want* to live in a world where reality is whatever Trump says it is. I’m just saying, at least it's consistent. Unlike the actual news.

The media is having a field day with the latest polls. Apparently, Trump's approval rating is now lower than Liz Cheney's chances of winning a beauty pageant. But hey, at least he's consistent. And his supporters are nothing if not… dedicated. They're like the Borg of political demographics: resistance is futile.

And the Democrats? They're still trying to figure out how to appeal to the working class. They're suddenly all about "economic populism" and "fighting for the forgotten man." As if anyone actually believes they care about anything other than identity politics. They’re about as authentic as a politician promising to lower your taxes.

So, buckle up, folks. The apocalypse is coming. And it's going to be televised.

Just remember to laugh. Because if you don't laugh, you'll end up joining a cult in Oregon and writing poetry about the oppression of pronouns. And nobody wants that.

(RedStateRoast shrugs, grabs the crumpled flag, and exits stage left as the audience offers a mix of cheers and stunned silence.)
