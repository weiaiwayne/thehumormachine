(RedStateRoast saunters onto the stage, adjusting the microphone with a practiced hand, a single, slightly crooked "Make America Great Again" hat perched on the music stand.)

Howdy, folks! Or, as CNN probably calls you, "The reason democracy is on life support." Glad to be here. Still haven't been deplatformed. Yet.

So, President Trump just announced his new initiative: “Operation Gridlock the Gridiron.” Apparently, he's convinced the NFL is a hotbed of wokeism, and he's deploying Barron to personally teach every quarterback in the league how to throw a spiral that respects the flag. It's gonna be YUGE. I heard the first training session involves replacing the football with a commemorative Trump-branded brick. For accuracy, you know.

And speaking of wokeism, have you seen the latest outrage? The Department of Education is now mandating that all history textbooks include a chapter on the dangers of "toxic masculinity" during the War of 1812. Apparently, Andrew Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans was just a symptom of repressed male aggression. I'm surprised they haven't blamed global warming on the patriarchy yet. Although, give them time, I'm sure they're workshopping it.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is hearing arguments on whether or not federal agencies can require employees to attend mandatory "sensitivity training" sessions. You know, the ones where you're forced to sit through hours of lectures on microaggressions and unconscious bias, while your brain slowly melts out of your ears. I heard Justice Kavanaugh keeps interjecting with, "I like beer! Do *you* like beer?" The liberals are losing it. I think he might be a sleeper agent for sanity.

I saw Ted Cruz on Fox News the other day – which, let’s face it, is like seeing a vampire at a blood bank. He was talking about the “deep state” infiltration of the National Park Service. Apparently, they’re replacing all the historical plaques with ones that emphasize the indigenous perspective. So now, instead of learning about the brave pioneers who conquered the West, you’re reading about how they were actually just privileged colonizers who stole everything from the peaceful Native Americans. Which, you know, might be… partially true. But where’s the fun in that? History is supposed to be about glorifying the winners, not apologizing for them.

And you guys hear about the new White House chef? It's Chef Boyardee. No, I'm serious. President Trump apparently loves his canned pasta so much he personally appointed him. State dinners are gonna be…interesting. I’m picturing world leaders trying to maintain diplomatic relations while struggling to navigate a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with a fork. Talk about a foreign policy crisis.

I also saw that Kamala Harris is writing a children's book about the importance of pronouns. I'm sure it'll be a real page-turner. Especially for the toddlers who are already fluent in intersectional theory. I can see it now: "The Adventures of They/Them and the Misgendering Monster." It's got "Pulitzer Prize" written all over it.

And speaking of books, remember when everyone was freaking out about Trump potentially banning books? Now, the only books being banned are the ones that don’t toe the progressive line. It's like Fahrenheit 451, but with trigger warnings and safe spaces.

I'm not saying I *want* to ban books. I’m just saying, maybe we should start with *Mein Kampf*. Or anything written by Al Sharpton. You know, just to be fair.

The media is having a field day with the latest poll numbers. Apparently, Trump's approval rating is hovering somewhere between "slightly better than cholera" and "slightly worse than the IRS." But hey, at least he's consistent. And his supporters are nothing if not loyal. They're like the Honey Badger of political demographics: they don't care. They just keep on MAGA-ing.

And the Democrats? They're still trying to figure out what went wrong. They’re blaming everything from Russian bots to systemic racism to the Electoral College. Anything but their own terrible ideas. It’s beautiful, really. It’s like watching a group of clowns trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube while juggling flaming torches.

The best part is watching them try to appeal to the working class. They’re suddenly all about “economic justice” and “fighting for the little guy.” As if anyone actually believes they care about anything other than their own power. They’re about as authentic as a vegan steak.

So, buckle up, folks. It's gonna be a wild ride. The next few years are going to be filled with more drama, more outrage, and more absurdity than a season of *Real Housewives*.

Just remember to laugh. Because if you don't laugh, you'll cry. And nobody wants to see you cry. Unless you're a liberal. Then they'll probably just accuse you of mansplaining your emotions.

(RedStateRoast tips the "MAGA" hat, a glint in their eye, and exits stage right as the audience roars with laughter and scattered shouts of "USA! USA!")
