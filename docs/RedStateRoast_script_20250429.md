Good evening, patriots, snowflakes, and everyone in between who accidentally stumbled onto this bastion of truth and common sense. Welcome to "Wake Up, America!", the only show brave enough to say what you’re thinking, probably because we have a legal team the size of Rhode Island.

First up, let’s talk about infrastructure. Remember when Biden promised to fix our roads and bridges? Turns out, he just painted them rainbow colors and declared them “inclusive.” Meanwhile, I just blew a tire dodging a pothole so big, it probably qualifies as a new national park. The Trump administration, however, is taking a different approach. We're not fixing the roads, we're building tunnels. Tunnels to the past, to a simpler time, when men were men, women were women, and gas was under two dollars a gallon. They're also rumored to lead to Mar-a-Lago, just in case. You know, for emergencies.

Speaking of emergencies, the latest climate report just dropped. Apparently, the polar bears are still sad, and the oceans are rising. But here’s the thing: if the oceans are rising, doesn’t that just mean more beach front property? Think about it. It’s capitalism, baby! Invest now, before Miami becomes the new Atlantis. And as for the polar bears, let's be honest, they're just lazy. Get a job, bears! There's plenty of ice fishing gigs out there. Maybe start a landscaping business. Polar bear landscaping. I'd hire them.

Now, onto the cultural front. The woke mob is at it again, folks. They're trying to cancel… Abraham Lincoln. Apparently, he owned slaves. Newsflash, snowflakes: so did half the country back then. Are we going to tear down Mount Rushmore next? Change the name of Washington D.C. to “Diversity City?” I swear, these people won't be happy until we’re all living in a gender-neutral, soy-based utopia. Fortunately, the Trump administration is fighting back. We’re launching a new initiative called "Make History Great Again," which involves rewriting textbooks to focus on the good parts of America, like the time we invented the cheeseburger.

And let's not forget about education. They're still teaching our kids about "critical race theory." Can you believe it? Critical *race* theory? As if race is even a thing. We’re all just Americans, folks. Except for the illegal immigrants, of course. They’re… something else. Anyway, to combat this indoctrination, the Trump administration is introducing a new curriculum: "American Exceptionalism 101." It covers all the important stuff, like how we won World War II single-handedly and invented the internet. And, of course, the undeniable greatness of Donald J. Trump.

In other news, Vice President Don Jr. just released his new line of hunting gear. It's all camouflage, naturally, but with a special twist: it’s designed to blend in with the walls of Congress. Perfect for sneaking up on those pesky Democrats. He’s calling it “The Swamp Thing Collection.” Very clever, Don Jr. Very clever.

And finally, a word about the media. They're still whining about "fake news." But let’s be real, the only fake news is the stuff they’re reporting. We here at "Wake Up, America!" are dedicated to bringing you the real truth, the unbiased truth, the truth that confirms all your pre-existing biases. It’s a public service, really.

Speaking of public service, remember to tune in next week, when we’ll be interviewing a man who claims to have been abducted by aliens and taught the secrets of conservative economics. It’s going to be… enlightening. Or possibly insane. Either way, it’ll be good TV.

**(RedStateRoast winks at the camera.)**

And that’s all the news that’s fit to print, burn, and then tweet about. God bless America, and God bless President Trump. Again.
