    <p><em>(Lights up on BlueScream, dressed in a bespoke hazmat suit printed with the faces of grinning billionaires. She's using a crystal ball as a paperweight.)</em></p>
<p>Welcome back to <em>Pre-Apocalyptic News &amp; Ha-Has</em>. I’m your host, BlueScream, still trying to decide if my new perfume, "Eau de Dystopia," is more smoky despair or lingering existential dread. Initial market research suggests… both.</p>
<p>So, another day, another descent into the rabbit hole of alternative facts, government-sanctioned gaslighting, and the nagging suspicion that we’re all just characters in a poorly-written reality show. And here to tell us more about this week’s chaos and carnage are my two guests! First, Vladimir Putin! Second, the sentient pile of sludge that is running the White House!</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s start with that NYC mayoral debate. Apparently, the leading candidates spent the entire time trying to out-Cuomo Cuomo. Which is a bit like watching a bunch of toddlers fighting over who gets to play with the rusty lawnmower.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s hard to get excited about New York politics these days. It’s like watching a particularly aggressive game of municipal hopscotch. The stakes are high, the competitors are… questionable, and the ultimate prize is… the crushing weight of managing a city that’s slowly sinking into the East River.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elon Musk, fresh from his stint as the White House's designated meme lord, has decided that Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” is a "disgusting abomination." This is… a complex situation. On one hand, it’s always nice to see a billionaire publicly denounce something that will disproportionately benefit billionaires. On the other hand, it’s Elon Musk, so you just <em>know</em> he's probably advocating for even <em>more</em> egregious tax cuts for himself. Think of him as the guy who complains about the size of the yacht parking space at the marina, even though he owns the whole marina.</p>
<p>And speaking of self-serving billionaires, it looks like all those DogeCoin enthusiasts can now buy access to a crypto wallet, but only after getting a blessing from the former President! I think. It's all very confusing. It's like a pyramid scheme built on a foundation of digital tulips and thinly veiled promises of… “financial freedom.” I’m starting to think the only thing less secure than a Trump-endorsed cryptocurrency is a Trump-endorsed prenup.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration is hard at work ensuring that our nation's future scientists and medical professionals are… uninformed. Education Secretary Linda McMahon is now refusing to say if teaching about the Tulsa Race Massacre or Ruby Bridges constitutes "illegal DEI." I can only assume she’s spending her days poring over Dr. Seuss books, desperately trying to glean some semblance of historical knowledge. "Oh, the places you'll go… to avoid teaching actual history!"</p>
<p>But hey, at least there’s some good news. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide gender-affirming care for transgender inmates. Which is… a start. I guess. It’s like giving a starving man a single crouton. At least they won’t die <em>completely</em> dysphoric.</p>
<p>And, as if on cue, Trump has banned nationals from twelve countries, citing security concerns. The timing is truly impeccable. It’s like he’s deliberately trying to craft a narrative where every tragedy is immediately followed by an act of xenophobic aggression. "See, folks? I'm not racist, I'm just… preemptively discriminating against entire nations based on the actions of a single, unhinged individual!" You know, the same guy who tried to carry out a terrorist attack?</p>
<p>And what's the point of all that? The White House budget proposes cutting funding for civil legal aid, making it even harder for low-income Americans to fight for their rights in court. Because, you know, justice is only for those who can afford it. The rest of us can just… eat the tariffs at Walmart.</p>
<p>In fact, just ask the people of Wyoming, who are now on the cusp of abolishing their property taxes! What's next for the people of Wyoming? Will they start bartering food in exchange for electricity? Will they start moving to Texas?</p>
<p>But then it is also time to look to the future! Some Democrats are now urging to make Musk an ally, because they are just not getting the message. Here is some advice, folks! Stop it. If the devil gets a flat tire, you don't help him out.</p>
<p>Which reminds me! A bunch of scientists have run off to Europe after the United States! Where are they going? Did their student loans get paid off? What's going on here?</p>
<p>But, no, let's stay positive! According to new reports, the White House hates Cuomo, they might pardon someone, and you may be able to taste some slightly-off Trump Steaks!</p>
<p>This week, the only thing that hasn’t changed is the near-certainty that things will somehow get worse. Until next week, folks, stay vigilant. And maybe invest in a good therapist. Or a sturdy tin foil hat. Or both.</p>
