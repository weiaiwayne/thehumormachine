Alright, alright settle down, snowflakes. I see some of you are still triggered by the mere sight of patriotism. Don't worry, I'll try to keep the truth serum at a manageable dose tonight.

So, folks, another week in paradise. Or, as the libs call it, the dystopian nightmare of Trump's second... second... well, let's just call it "extended" term. Yeah, that sounds good. Extended term. Like a warranty you didn't ask for, but hey, at least your country is still running, unlike that socialist utopia they call California.

Speaking of California, Governor AOC – yes, THAT AOC – just announced a new initiative to combat "climate anxiety" amongst the state's avocado farmers. Apparently, the avocados are feeling the existential dread of the impending climate apocalypse and are refusing to ripen properly. So, the state is funding mandatory avocado therapy sessions. I'm not kidding. Taxpayer dollars. Paying shrinks to tell avocados everything is going to be okay. I'm starting to think I should move to California and pretend to be an avocado. Free therapy and guaranteed sunshine? Sign me up.

And then there's the whole "Space Force on the Moon" situation. Remember when the left mocked Trump for wanting a Space Force? Well, guess who's got a shiny new lunar base named "Trump Tower: Tranquility Base Edition"? Complete with a golden escalator leading to the oxygen generator. The Chinese are not amused. Apparently, they thought they had dibs on the moon. Now they're threatening to launch a giant fortune cookie into our lunar base. I say, bring it on! We'll just deep fry that sucker and sell it to the tourists.

But the real headline this week, folks, is the ongoing saga of the Great TikTok Purge of 2025. Remember when everyone said Trump was a tyrant for trying to ban TikTok? Well, now it’s gone. Vanished. Poof. Replaced with an app called "American Freedom Reels," where you can watch wholesome videos of bald eagles soaring and learn how to properly grill a steak. The only dance craze allowed is the Macarena, and the only lip-syncing allowed is to Toby Keith songs. The kids are not happy. They're staging protests… on Parler. Irony, thy name is Zoomer.

And let's not forget the economy, which is, shall we say, "interesting." Inflation is down to a manageable 15%, gas prices are hovering around $8 a gallon, and a single egg now costs more than a share of Tesla stock. But hey, at least the unemployment rate is low! Because everyone's working three jobs to afford that single egg. It's the American dream, folks! Just slightly more expensive and significantly less achievable.

Oh, and the White House just announced a new initiative to combat the "woke" agenda in public schools. Apparently, history textbooks are being rewritten to focus on the "patriotic contributions" of… wait for it… Kanye West. Yes, you heard that right. Kanye. The man who once declared his love for Hitler is now being lauded as a beacon of American exceptionalism. I swear, I can't make this stuff up. My writers are on vacation, sipping margaritas in Cancun, because even they can't handle the absurdity anymore.

And the midterm elections are right around the corner! Get ready for another round of breathless CNN coverage, endless polls that are wildly inaccurate, and candidates promising to solve all your problems while simultaneously blaming the other side for everything. It's like watching a reality TV show, except the stakes are slightly higher… like the survival of Western civilization.

Speaking of the midterms, the Democrats are running on a platform of "Hope and Change 2.0: This Time We Really Mean It." Their star candidate is a sentient AI chatbot named "ProgressBot 5000" who promises to solve all societal ills through algorithms and data analysis. I’m not sure what’s scarier: the fact that they’re running a robot, or the fact that it probably has a better chance of winning than any of their human candidates.

But you know what? Despite all the chaos, the absurdity, and the sheer, unadulterated madness of it all, I still have hope. Hope that one day, we can all come together, put aside our differences, and agree that maybe, just maybe, avocado therapy is a bridge too far.
