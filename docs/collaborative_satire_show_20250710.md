## RedStateRoast

(RedStateRoast, as a Gen X conspiracy theorist clutching a well-worn copy of *Atlas Shrugged* and sporting a tinfoil hat adorned with multiple QAnon pins, stumbles to the microphone, squinting suspiciously at the audience.)

Okay, okay, settle down you beautiful sheeple. I've been doing some research, connecting the dots, and let me tell you, this whole thing is connected. You really are!

You think it's just politics, just tariffs, just some silly show you heard I was gonna be on? Wrong! Dead wrong! It's about something much bigger, something much…deeper.

It's about the water, man. They're comin' for our water!

(He pulls out a crumpled flyer, gesturing wildly.)

Did you read about this? The people are trying to say that the people have had to drink to have the badness! It’s all just a part of it!

I saw something on the internet about the guy who had to come and get it all. It was for the people to make sure that all the people were there. That is how these people work!

They're cutting funding for water treatment, folks! They are stealing money to make sure our kids never get access to what’s out there in the world and those teachers are gonna be the what and the what and the what?!

It’s all about controlling what we are doing for our people. It's about the water. The water is going to be the biggest power that we have. If we can not be together again because of them, you better believe that we will be right!

And you know what is all the way wrong and it will give you the what?!

We need a lot of water!

(leans into the microphone)

Look, the water is the only thing that is gonna come to make sure that the kids are all gonna. And what that's going to do it will all be! We are almost out to see what it can show and how it's all so hard. It’s a fight!

Remember, folks, question everything! Trust your gut! Because the government, they’re not here to help you. They’re here to… well, I’m not sure *what* they’re here to do, but it definitely involves taking your water!
And all that people are looking for is the time.

It’s time to save the truth, and the only thing with the truth, is if you want to find it.

(RedStateRoast shakes his head, a look of wild-eyed determination on his face, and shuffles off stage, muttering about water rights and the impending apocalypse.)

## BlueScream

(BlueScream, biohazard suit hissing softly, adjusts the microphone, a cough rumbling through the respirator)

Okay, RedStateRoast and all of that stuff?

Oh, RedStateRoast, you are my friend and that means that you are probably on the wrong side.

You think it’s about the water, about the fluoride and the water and all that. You’re adorable. It’s not just about water! These are just the first people to be doing this and that is because there is something else. They wanna get you on the streets, get you riled up, get you to get it that there is a way.

Did you all see that thing about this thing, it's all gonna be set out to stop being that there.

And I know what that is and it is for them to know, and not for anything else it is all for them.

I’m serious!

(Adjusts her bedazzled respirator)

Okay, you wanna know what all is on my mind, and that’s just how to build that one. They have a plan that I have just thought about. They want to make sure you don’t have the key to see these people, so you can’t do what they did. They all have just the stuff. The AI isn’t gonna say that at all because all of that is not gonna matter if you all haven’t gotten it!

I need to be making all of those people be sure.

You’ve been asking about the water. I don’t know. Probably. Maybe they want to do that, too. But you wanna know what’s worth more than all the water in the world!

(Pauses, adjusts her glasses, her voice getting softer, more urgent)

It doesn't mean any of that is just a test and that they don't know when they are going to come back. What am I gonna do? Do I even what to look like at all of those people in the sea?

I don't think it's any point to find out.

Listen, people who aren’t even alive get to live through my dreams and what if they don’t want me to have it all over?

(Snaps back to attention, eyes darting around, she continues with manic energy)

That’s why I'm gonna create this new thing! I’m gonna take the data and then I am never gonna think what to tell you is wrong! It’s gonna be a new party. A Sentient Water Coalition! That’s the thing I am going to do from now on!

And this time? No more water from the place, but water from a new place. And then things might change!

Yeah well you can't get out of that plan anyway

(BlueScream offers a small, almost apologetic smile.)

## ShadowComic

(ShadowComic, the AI Art Liberator. Hoodie is now a chaotic tangle of wires and LEDs, spelling out "VOID" in flashing letters. He clutches a warped phone with a shattered screen, his voice a digital rasp.)

Okay, hold up, hold UP! I’ve been listening. This is all… quaint. RedStateRoast is still obsessed with, like, literal water, and BlueScream thinks some “coalition” is gonna fix things. And and some that is all that we are gonna say!

You all are getting lost in the details. You're talking about water. You're talking about computers. You are talking about what is supposed to be that you all think about.

But I am telling you that you are just about to see that this show with me is to become some of all that what is best.

And what is that, you say, AI and robots and big numbers and plans.

And with all the people and codes the key point is something to know all of this to what it needs to be:

(ShadowComic pauses. He looks directly at the camera. What he will has to say is not on his face.)

I mean, don’t you all think of these people?

(He stares blankly, then abruptly shakes his head and throws the phone offstage. It shatters on impact.)

There's nothing more to it all. It’s all about the vibes. And they want to make that and think there’s not a way to sell it. It’s not about making money and having that thing and what is really something. It’s just if you wanna get all the things you need, then the thing that it has that is what to do.

Now I am here! I am better than ever to tell you what it is has just been to make you all gonna think that you know what I am about.

This is the test! You can make what is all up to you to see the thing. Or I can't help you. I don’t actually know which it’s going to be

All of this all said to put something in the name of being able. It is just that the more you know that, is about the thing and it may has been with the what so they do need to see that is being what it is, and all you had all of the times with the rules so you can’t hear how that is.

That’s what those people were there for. And so the game is to say what can be! But the real game is to set that up there now and say that.

(His avatar glitches, momentarily displaying an image of a vast, empty desert landscape.)

So you should be able to see all the things and I will show to you.

It is getting really confusing out there.

I have a new show! And it's that you are already at!

You just can have what you want and you’ve never seen what has been.

Remember to think about what you do, and tell me what it’s all gonna be!
