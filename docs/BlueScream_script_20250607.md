Welcome back to *Apocalypse: Now Streaming*, where tonight we're examining the political landscape through the lens of… what’s the opposite of rose-colored glasses? Septic tank goggles?

Yes, that's right I am BlueScream

This week, the news has been… well, let’s just say if I didn’t know better, I’d swear we were all starring in some deranged off-Broadway adaptation of *Idiocracy* directed by Michael Bay. With a cameo by a particularly unhinged Roomba.

First off, congratulations to Elon Musk and Donald Trump on their divorce. It’s always heartwarming to see two titans of industry, two beacons of stability and rational thought, engaging in a public spat more befitting a pair of middle schoolers arguing over who gets to sit next to the popular girl at lunch.

"He’s in the Epstein files!" accuses Musk, like that's some sort of gotcha. As if *half* the Republican party *isn't* already on Epstein’s flight logs. It’s less a secret society and more a frequent flyer program for the… *morally flexible*.

And Trump, naturally, is responding with the kind of measured, nuanced rhetoric we’ve all come to expect. He is calling Musk names, but also reminding everyone about Space Force because who will defend America if the martians come to destroy us?

But let's be real, this isn’t about Epstein. This isn’t about policy. This is about two alpha males, two demigods of ego, locked in a battle of wills so intense that the very fabric of reality is starting to fray. I swear, I saw a squirrel wearing a MAGA hat the other day. *And it was driving a Cybertruck*.

And what do they do with this chaos? Start a 3rd party? We need a new political party with even more billionaires, right?

Meanwhile, in other news from the world of "How is this real life?", our new Surgeon General, RFK Jr., is now suggesting that heat waves aren't really a big deal and that people with money can buy AC, so what's the problem? It's like Marie Antoinette deciding the peasant problem can be solved with a well placed solar panel.

The Supreme Court is *still* blocking deportations and this, and that which makes things really hard because then they can't get to 800 new hires the Department of Homeland Security needs to hire.

And let's take stock of where we're at with what all of our Congress people are doing. All that and a bag of hair!

Speaking of Texas, that state is now one step closer to mandating the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. Because nothing says “quality education” like forcing impressionable young minds to memorize a list of rules written by Bronze Age shepherds.

I can see it now: “Okay, class, today we’re going to learn about the scientific method… but first, let’s all recite ‘Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s ox’!”

And it gets worse, because if the kids misbehave now, there is a high risk that mom could be in jail.

And as the world burns and the seas rise, our elected officials are busy… well, they’re mostly busy sending out fundraising emails and complaining about being unfairly targeted by the media. Because, apparently, holding power accountable is now considered an act of treason.

The real crime would be telling you everything is going to be ok. It is time to start hoarding water and bread.

And because I'm contractually obligated to end on a vaguely optimistic note, let me remind you that at least we’re all in this together. We’re all staring into the abyss, hand in hand, wondering if maybe, just maybe, the sentient sourdough bread will finally rise up and save us.

This has been *Despair Hour*. Remember, stay informed, stay vigilant, and for the love of God, don’t vote for anyone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by… uh… Big Windmill.

Good night, and may the odds be ever in your favor. Or, you know, at least mildly inconvenient.
