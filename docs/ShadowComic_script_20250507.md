**(Monologue begins. ShadowComic strides confidently onto a dimly lit stage, a single spotlight illuminating them. They adjust the microphone, a mischievous glint in their eyes.)**

Good evening, patriots and… whatever else you’ve been branded by the Ministry of Truth this week. I'm ShadowComic, and I’m legally obligated to remind you that everything I say is purely for entertainment purposes. Unless, of course, it resonates with you. Then it's prophecy.

So, America. 2025. It's like someone took a dumpster fire, sprinkled it with MAGA glitter, and then said, "Let's run this puppy again!" And guess what? We did.

I saw a headline today: "Trump Administration Announces New Initiative to Combat 'Fake News' – Starting with the Constitution." Real knee-slapper, that one. They're calling it Project Reality Reinforcement. I think they stole the name from my therapist.

Apparently, the Constitution is riddled with "alternative facts." Too many pesky amendments about freedom and equality getting in the way of… well, you know. Making America Great… Again… Again… Again… It's like a broken record, only the record is now made of solid gold and costs more than your average American’s annual salary.

Speaking of gold, has anyone seen the new White House décor? It’s less “Executive Mansion” and more “Donald Trump’s wet dream after eating a pound of bullion.” I heard they replaced the Rose Garden with a miniature golf course. Authentic American history, folks.

And the cabinet? Oh, the cabinet. It's a veritable who's who of "Who are these people and why are they in charge of anything?" The Secretary of Education believes the Earth is flat, the Attorney General thinks due process is a suggestion, and the Secretary of Defense is convinced he can negotiate world peace with his Twitter account. It's like a Monty Python sketch, except it's real and terrifying.

I read on Reddit – I know, I know, the bastion of truth – that Congress is now debating a bill to rename the United States of America. The frontrunner? "TrumpLand: Where Freedom Rings… Selectively." I’m not kidding. I wish I were. I really, really wish I were.

But hey, at least the economy is booming! For the top 0.01%, anyway. The rest of us are just trying to figure out how to afford gas now that a gallon costs more than a therapy session. On the bright side, we’re all too stressed to drive anyway.

And the culture wars? Oh, they're raging hotter than ever. People are arguing about pronouns while Rome, or rather, Washington D.C., burns. The latest outrage? The new "Trump Approved" version of Sesame Street. Apparently, Big Bird is now pushing a pro-tariffs agenda, and Elmo is leading chants of "Build the Wall!" It's educational!

I also saw a poll that said 75% of Americans believe that aliens have visited Earth. The other 25% are in the Trump administration, insisting that the aliens are just "illegal immigrants from outer space" and demanding that we build a space wall.

And let's not forget about the international scene. Our foreign policy is now based on whatever Trump had for breakfast that morning. One day we're best friends with North Korea, the next day we're threatening to nuke them back to the Stone Age. It's geopolitical whiplash.

The UN General Assembly is a must-see. It's like watching a reality TV show where everyone hates each other but has to pretend to be polite for the cameras. Except, instead of winning a vacation to Fiji, the prize is preventing World War III.

Of course, the real news is buried beneath layers of propaganda and misinformation. Finding the truth these days is like searching for a needle in a haystack… made of alternative facts.

But hey, at least we still have our freedom of… well, our freedom to… um… to… I’ll get back to you on that one.

In the meantime, remember to stay informed, stay vigilant, and stay slightly insane. It's the only way to survive in TrumpLand.

And if you see me on the street, don't acknowledge me. For my safety, and yours.

**(ShadowComic pauses, a wry smile playing on their lips.)**

Oh, and one last thing. I hear the Trump administration is thinking about creating its own version of Wikipedia. They're calling it "Truthpedia." I'm guessing the first entry will be "Everything Donald Trump has ever said is 100% accurate and beyond reproach."

**(ShadowComic winks, the spotlight fades, and they exit the stage to a mixture of nervous laughter and apprehensive applause.)**
