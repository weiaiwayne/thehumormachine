Good evening, and welcome back to “Truth Serum,” the only show committed to injecting reality directly into your eyeballs, regardless of whether your eyeballs have given informed consent.

So, another week, another dumpster fire delicately perfumed with the scent of freedom fries. It seems like just yesterday we were all huddled in our bunkers, wondering if the world would end with a whimper or a tweet. Turns out, it ended with a meme. Progress!

Yes folks, it's 2025, and as Nostradamus predicted, but not very clearly, we’re back in the loving embrace of… well, you know. Let’s just call him “The Tangerine Dream.” He's like that recurring nightmare you can't shake, except instead of waking up sweating, you wake up owing Russia money.

And what a week it's been. First, the President unveiled his new infrastructure plan. Forget bridges and roads. This plan focuses solely on building a giant golden statue of himself holding a golf club. Apparently, it's crucial for national security. "How else will our enemies know who's in charge?" he reportedly asked. And you know what? He's got a point. I mean, subtlety is so… 2016.

The Democrats, bless their hearts, are predictably up in arms. They've proposed a counter-bill focusing on actual infrastructure, like, you know, things that don’t require a crane and a lifetime supply of spray tan. But let's be real, their bill has about as much chance of passing as I do of getting invited to Mar-a-Lago. The only thing Congress agrees on these days is that arguing is more fun than governing. It's like watching professional wrestlers, except the wrestlers have control over your healthcare.

And speaking of healthcare, remember that whole "repeal and replace" thing? Well, it's back! Only this time, the replacement is even more ingenious. It's called "Thoughts and Prayers Plus." Basically, if you get sick, you just think really hard about being healthy, and then you pray. They’re even offering a premium package that includes a signed photo of a celebrity endorsing positive thinking. Side effects may include bankruptcy and death, but hey, at least you'll have a nice picture.

But the real story this week is the new Supreme Court nomination. You know, because we didn't have enough conservative justices already. This time, the nominee is a sentient AI chatbot named "JusticeBot 5000." Its only qualification is that it agrees with everything the President says, and it never needs to sleep. Critics argue that it lacks empathy and understanding of the human condition. But hey, who needs empathy when you have algorithms?

The White House insists that JusticeBot 5000 is perfectly qualified, pointing out that it has read every legal precedent ever written. "It's the smartest justice we've ever had!" the press secretary declared. Which, considering the bar, isn't saying much. I mean, my Roomba probably has a higher IQ than some of the current justices. And at least the Roomba cleans up messes.

Meanwhile, the economy is booming! At least, that's what they tell us. Unemployment is at an all-time low, but so are wages. It's like we're all working harder for less, while the top 1% are busy building bunkers on Mars. But hey, at least we have jobs! Even if those jobs involve licking boots and pretending everything is normal.

And the media? Don't even get me started. They're all too busy chasing clicks and outrage to actually report the news. It's like they're competing to see who can be the most sensational, the most divisive, the most… well, the most Trumpian. And we, the viewers, are just sitting here, shoveling popcorn into our mouths and watching the world burn.

But hey, it's not all bad news. At least we still have Netflix. And avocado toast. And the unwavering belief that things will eventually get better. Right? Right?

**(BlueScream stares intensely into the camera for a beat, then sighs.)**

Okay, maybe not. But hey, at least we can laugh about it. Because if we don't laugh, we'll cry. And crying is bad for your skin.

**(BlueScream pauses for audience laughter, sips from a water bottle, and continues.)**

In other news, the Department of Education has announced a new initiative to teach children critical thinking skills. Just kidding! I made that up. They’re actually teaching them how to identify fake news. By showing them
