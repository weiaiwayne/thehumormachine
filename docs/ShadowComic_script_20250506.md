Good evening. Or, as they say in the newly rebranded Department of Patriotic Affirmation, "Have a most blessed evening of American Excellence!"

So, Trump's back. Again. Turns out, draining the swamp was less like draining a swamp and more like refilling a kiddie pool with Diet Coke. It fizzed for a bit, then just got sticky.

I see some new faces in the audience. Welcome. If you’re here for the "safe space" comedy, you’re in the wrong place. You want Carrot Top across the street. He's got props. We’ve just got…reality.

Speaking of reality, remember when we thought 2020 was rock bottom? Turns out, that was just the preliminary excavation. We've hit bedrock now. Bedrock made of solid gold toilets and conspiracy theories.

I’ve been reading Reddit. Apparently, the new Secretary of Education—a woman who believes the Earth is flat but also that it’s the center of the universe *and* a hollow shell inhabited by lizard people—is pushing for mandatory cursive classes. Because, you know, the real problem with our kids is they can’t forge historical documents efficiently.

And the new Attorney General? He’s announced that all courtrooms will now be equipped with polygraph machines. Not for witnesses, mind you. For the *judges*. To ensure they’re “truly” upholding the Constitution. Apparently, the Constitution now includes a clause about owning at least three AR-15s and believing that Hillary Clinton runs a pizza parlor that moonlights as a biolab.

The economy is…well, it’s an economy. It’s got things. Prices are up. Wages are…also things. People are working. Mostly at the new Trump Gold-Plated Burger Emporiums, where the minimum wage is a signed MAGA hat and a complimentary side of grievances.

I saw a headline today: "President Trump Declares War on the Oxford Comma." I’m not even kidding. He says it’s “elitist” and “un-American.” Apparently, it’s a gateway drug to socialism. He followed up with a tweet threatening to "bomb the dictionary until it cries." I'm pretty sure that's a war crime. But hey, who’s counting?

And the international stage? Let's just say diplomacy is now conducted via interpretive dance-offs. Our ambassador to France recently challenged Macron to a breakdancing battle over trade tariffs. Macron won, obviously. But Trump declared victory anyway, citing "alternative facts" and claiming Macron used performance-enhancing berets.

Climate change? Oh, that’s been rebranded as “American Weather Optimization.” We’re no longer denying it; we’re just…improving it. The new strategy involves massive geoengineering projects like painting all glaciers white with industrial-grade paint and launching giant fans into the atmosphere to “blow the hot air away.” I’m not sure which is worse: the environmental damage or the sheer, breathtaking stupidity.

They’ve also started replacing all the national park signs with Trump-themed slogans. "Yellowstone: Now Featuring More Gold Than Ever Before!" "The Grand Canyon: Still Bigger Than Anything Obama Ever Did!" "Yosemite: Where Freedom Rings…and Also Your Phone If You Have AT&T!"

The media, of course, is thriving. Not in the sense of journalistic integrity, but in the sense that cockroaches thrive after a nuclear apocalypse. Every morning, I wake up, check Twitter to see which journalist has been declared an “Enemy of the People” today, and then I spend the rest of the day trying to remember where I parked my car. Priorities, people.

But here's the thing that keeps me up at night. It's not the blatant corruption, the rampant misinformation, or the creeping authoritarianism. It's the normalization. It's the way we're all just…shrugging. Like, "Yeah, this is awful, but what are you gonna do?"

We're all becoming cynical connoisseurs of dystopia. We're critiquing the wallpaper while the house is burning down. We’re arguing over the shade of orange on Trump’s face while he’s dismantling democracy brick by brick.

And I get it. It's exhausting. It's relentless. It's like being stuck in a never-ending episode of *The Twilight Zone*, except Rod Serling is replaced by Alex Jones, and the twist ending is just…more of the same.

But we can’t afford to be exhausted. We can’t afford to shrug. We can’t afford to normalize
