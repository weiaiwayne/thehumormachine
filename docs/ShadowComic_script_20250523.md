ShadowComic: Evening, folks. Another day, another existential crisis disguised as ‘news.’

(He exhales, a faint smirk playing on his lips.)

So, the House just passed this “BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.” I'd call it 'creative,' but I’m pretty sure the only thing being created is a bigger deficit and a whole lotta heartburn for the future. Think of it as fiscal liposuction: all the fat is sucked out of essential services and pumped directly into the already engorged arteries of the ultra-wealthy.

And to distract you from the fact that your access to, oh, I don’t know, *healthcare* is about to be downgraded to interpretive dance and positive thinking, they’ve thrown in a provision designed to handcuff the judiciary. It's like watching a toddler trying to build a LEGO tower while simultaneously setting the instructions on fire.

Apparently, Trump wants to ensure that no pesky judge can actually *enforce* any rulings against him. I mean, why bother with all that pesky 'checks and balances' stuff? It's so... *old*. So... *democratic*. So... *not very strongman*. I’m pretty sure if you whisper "checks and balances" into Trump's ear, he'll immediately demand someone build a wall around them. Just to be safe.

(He stubs out the cigarette.)

Speaking of walls, Harvard. Our nation’s intellectual bastion...well, one of them at least until Trump is done with them, is now officially barred from enrolling foreign students. Because, you know, nothing screams "Make America Great Again" like closing our borders to the best and brightest minds. I mean, who needs brainpower when you’ve got… well, let’s just call it “alternative thinking.”

Germany, proving that history really does rhyme, has offered Harvard an “exile campus.” An exile campus! Folks, we’re living in a bad historical fiction novel written by someone who clearly failed high school civics.

And then there’s our buddy, Elon. He said he was stepping back from government involvement. Right. As if a megalomaniac with a Twitter addiction can just *walk away* from power. That’s like saying a toddler will voluntarily hand back a loaded diaper. He’s still pulling strings, still expanding his AI’s influence, all while probably cackling maniacally from his Mars-bound rocket. Or maybe that’s just the sound of his investors’ portfolios plummeting.

(He leans forward conspiratorially.)

Here’s the real joke: It’s not just Trump or Elon. It’s the *system* that allows this to happen. It’s the way we’ve normalized absurdity. It’s the fact that we’re all sitting here, watching the slow-motion demolition of democracy and commenting on it like it’s a particularly dramatic episode of *Housewives*.

And then, of course, there’s the memecoin dinner. You can pay for access to the leader. Is this the United States of America or a very expensive carnival?

(He pauses, letting the silence hang in the air.)

But hey, at least we’re not talking about [insert name of some forgettable celebrity]. Progress, right?

Oh, and another thing, they are putting armed security around a nuclear facility. It's like protecting a toddler with a flamethrower, but who am I to question the government?

(He pushes his fedora back slightly, revealing a glint in his eye.)

So, what’s the takeaway? Simple. Buy gold. Learn a foreign language. And for God's sake, start paying attention.

Because folks, the punchline? The punchline is us.

**(ShadowComic flicks off the spotlight, plunging the desk into darkness. Only the faint ember of his cigarette remains.)**
