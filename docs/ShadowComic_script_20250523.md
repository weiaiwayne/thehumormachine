**(Open on ShadowComic, bathed in a sickly orange glow, fiddling with a fidget spinner shaped like a miniature gold toilet. He's wearing a 'Make America Kind Again' hat, ironically.)**

ShadowComic: Good evening, and welcome to another episode of "Surviving Tomorrow, Today." I'm your host, ShadowComic, and I'm starting to think my therapist is charging me extra for ‘trauma exposure therapy’ disguised as a co-pay.

(He flicks the fidget spinner)

So, the House passed Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." I'm not sure if that's the official name or what Trump shouts after a particularly successful colonoscopy. Either way, it's here, it's real, and it's… *bigly bad*.

(He raises an eyebrow)

It's so beautiful, in fact, that Republicans had to sneak it through at 1 AM, like a teenager smuggling a glitter-covered unicorn bong into their parents’ basement. They knew it was wrong, but the unicorn… *called to them*.

And what’s in this beautiful package? Tax cuts for the rich, naturally. Because in America, trickle-down economics are like that ex you can’t quit – they’re always promising things will be different this time, even though you know they're just going to leave you with an empty bank account and a vague sense of shame.

And just to sweeten the deal, they're gutting Medicaid. Because, you know, who needs healthcare when you can have a "Trump Account" for your newborn? It’s a special savings account loaded with $1,000. Enough to cover… *one urgent care visit*. The rest is up to you, little Timmy. May the odds be ever in your favor.

(He chuckles darkly)

Meanwhile, Senator JD Vance, the intellectual heir to… *a bag of unsorted Legos*, is out there saying Putin has "re-engineered his entire economy." I guess that re-engineering involves… *annexing washing machines*? Because, let's be honest, if Putin's economy is so strong, why are they still fighting with Soviet-era tanks? It's like showing up to the Indy 500 with a Yugo.

(He sighs dramatically)

And speaking of strong economies, Qatar is offering Trump a "used" 747 as a diplomatic gift. A *used* 747. It's like getting socks for Christmas, except those socks were previously worn by a Middle Eastern monarch, and probably smell faintly of… *intrigue*.

And of course, Trump's still obsessed with Greenland. Apparently, they signed a lucrative minerals deal with Europe. Which is clearly an act of war. I expect a strongly worded tweet… *followed by the annexation of Denmark*.

(He leans into the microphone)

But the real showstopper? The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on birthright citizenship. Because why not? The Constitution is just a *guideline*, people. Like speed limits or basic human decency.

And as if that weren't enough, Oklahoma is requiring schools to teach Trump's 2020 election conspiracy theories. So, buckle up, kids! It's time to learn about the *deep state lizard people who stole the election with… Venezuelan voting machines*. It's educational! It’s… *terrifying*!

(He spins the fidget spinner again, faster)

And while all this is happening, the Army is planning a massive military parade in DC. A birthday parade, apparently. Not for Washington, not for Lincoln, but for… *the guy who dodged the draft with bone spurs*. The Golden Knights are even parachuting in to present him with a folded flag. I'm sure the veterans sleeping on the streets will appreciate the… *optics*.

(He stares blankly into the camera)

But hey, at least the show is entertaining, right? Just remember folks, laughter is the best medicine. Except for, you know… *actual medicine*. Which, thanks to this administration, is about to become a luxury only the elite can afford.

(He drops the fidget spinner. It spins to a halt.)

Good night, and may your Xanax prescription be strong. You're gonna need it.
