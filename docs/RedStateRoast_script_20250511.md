Good evening, patriots, snowflakes, and everyone in between. Welcome back to "Keeping America Sane," the only show brave enough to say what you're thinking while your HR department is silently judging you.

So, another week, another avalanche of liberal tears. Honestly, you’d think they’d be used to it by now. It’s been four years. Four glorious years of making America great again, again. And yet, the wailing persists.

Speaking of wailing, have you seen the latest outrage? Apparently, President Trump's new executive order mandating that all government buildings replace their modern art with Norman Rockwell paintings is "cultural appropriation." Cultural appropriation! As if those whiny hipsters even *know* what culture is. Last time I checked, "culture" wasn't kale smoothies and pronouns. It was apple pie, freedom, and knowing which bathroom to use.

And the hypocrisy is just breathtaking. These are the same people who think it's perfectly acceptable to tear down statues of historical figures because they disagree with their views. But *gasp*, don't touch their abstract blobs of paint! That's "art"! No, honey, that's what happens when you let a chimpanzee loose with a bucket of finger paint.

Meanwhile, Vice President Don Jr. is embroiled in another scandal. Apparently, his new line of "MAGA-wear" hunting gear is made in China. The left is clutching their pearls, screaming "hypocrisy!" I say, so what? He’s a businessman! He’s finding the best deals! Besides, those Chinese commies need to learn a thing or two about capitalism. Maybe if they buy enough "Make America Great Again" camouflage, they'll finally understand the beauty of a free market.

Speaking of China, Secretary of Defense Kid Rock just announced a new initiative to train bald eagles to carry drones. He says it's a "strategic deterrent" and a "symbol of American freedom." The media is calling it "absurd" and "dangerous." I call it awesome. Imagine the look on Xi Jinping's face when a majestic bald eagle swoops down and delivers a package of freedom right to his doorstep. He’ll probably think it’s a new strain of bird flu.

But the real story this week is the ongoing debate over the proposed "American Values Act." This groundbreaking piece of legislation would require all public schools to teach traditional American values, like hard work, personal responsibility, and the importance of owning a firearm. The left is predictably losing their minds, claiming it's "indoctrination" and "fascism."

Indoctrination? Please. Last time I checked, teaching kids about the Founding Fathers wasn't fascism. It was history. And teaching them about personal responsibility? That's just common sense. You know, something sorely lacking in today’s youth. They’re all too busy protesting and demanding free stuff.

And as for the firearms part, well, what’s more American than a kid knowing how to handle a gun? It's a constitutional right! Besides, it's better than teaching them how to use TikTok. That’s a national security threat waiting to happen.

Of course, the real reason the left is so opposed to the "American Values Act" is because they know it will work. They know that if we teach our kids the right values, they won't grow up to be virtue-signaling socialists who hate America. And that’s their biggest fear.

But fear not, patriots. We’re not going to let them win. We’re going to keep fighting for what’s right. We’re going to keep making America great. And we’re going to keep laughing at the left's ridiculous antics along the way.

And speaking of ridiculous, have you seen the new "gender-neutral" bathroom signs at the White House? They're just blank doors. Apparently, you're supposed to "feel your way" to the correct restroom. I'm not even kidding. This is what happens when you let identity politics run wild. You end up with a bunch of confused people wandering around the White House, desperately searching for a toilet.

But hey, at least it's entertaining. And in these crazy times, we need all the entertainment we can get. So, keep laughing, keep fighting, and keep making America great.

And now, a word from our sponsor: "MyPillow." Because apparently, even in 2025, you still need a decent pillow to get a good night's sleep after arguing with liberals on the internet all day.
