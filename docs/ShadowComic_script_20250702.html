    <p>(ShadowComic, as a broke philosophy student)</p>
<p>Okay, so, like, remember when we all thought 2016 was peak “What the Actual Hell?” Yeah, we were so naive back then. Now we got, what is it, “Alligator Alcatraz?” Seriously, who comes up with these names? Sounds like a rejected title from a rejected SyFy channel movie. </p>
<p>And apparently, there's a $250 dollar Trump fragance. I'm sure it is a mix of spray tan and desparation. </p>
<p>(Sighs)</p>
<p>But, hey, at least we're protecting our borders, right? Except, like, the Supreme Court’s just letting Trump deport whoever he wants now, so, you know, due process is canceled. I keep seeing that it’s 12 million folks. 12 million people, gone just like that. </p>
<p>This is why it is better to just live out in the mountains. I just came across the thing that says the government is just gonna pay for all of that it is just so sad to see it be the same over and again. The problem is what that all even does is so wrong. But what is the point? You can’t even do anything, you know! </p>
<p>It’s just that I don’t even understand all of this stuff with the government is what it is all about.</p>
<p>Then you look back at that old-timey thing about going to court or having the thing and you’re like, what have the aliens have done to us?</p>
<p>Anyway, as a result, this will likely have people living on the street and then you get that thing where they have to eat their own arm. And, hey, here is the thing:</p>
<p>(Holds up a can of dollar-store beans)</p>
<p>Remember 2016? The good old days? The thing that I knew what it all was. It's all gonna just do a whole bunch of stuff! It's always gonna be going around again and again so if it is all the same when you get to heaven.</p>
<p>So I say to you. The important thing is to never have a belief.</p>
<p>(Pauses for a beat, then shrugs)</p>
<h2>But hey, at least it’s not boring. Am I right?</h2>
