    <p>(ShadowComic, tonight dressed as a park ranger – complete with an aggressively sincere smile and a Smokey Bear hat perched precariously on his head – shuffles onto the stage, dragging a whiteboard covered in conspiracy theories.)</p>
<p>Howdy, folks! Welcome to “Understanding America’s Ecosystem of Crazy”, where we explore the delicate balance between delusion and…well, more delusion. I'm your guide, Ranger ShadowComic, and remember: Leave only footprints, take only… screenshots of unhinged Reddit threads.</p>
<p>(He beams at the audience, then winces at the whiteboard)</p>
<p>So, the House finally passed Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Sounds like a prize you win at a carnival, right after you fail to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar. Turns out, the jellybeans are actually Medicaid cuts, and the prize is…well, let's just say it involves a significantly smaller safety net. You get a tax break! And YOU get a tax break! But only if you're already rich. Everyone else gets slightly less…everything.</p>
<p>And speaking of things getting smaller, Trump's been on a tear about Harvard, banning those pesky foreign students. Because apparently, the best way to Make America Great Again is to…deport the world’s best and brightest to China. I guess “Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free… unless they’re good at math” just didn’t fit on the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>Naturally, the world didn’t take this lying down. A university in Hong Kong is now offering Harvard’s international students “unconditional offers.” It’s like a twisted academic version of “The Bachelorette.” “Will you accept this rose…and a scholarship to a country that isn’t actively trying to dismantle its own education system?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, in a move that surprised absolutely no one, sided with Trump on firing independent agency heads. Because what America <em>really</em> needs is <em>less</em> oversight and <em>more</em> unchecked executive power. It’s like giving a toddler a flamethrower and saying, “Go wild! Just…try not to burn down the house.” I think that what America truly needs is a new Supreme Court, in which every Justice is a robot who can make decisions on only logic and justice. But that's probably too difficult of a task for our leader at the moment.</p>
<p>The silver lining? Chief Justice Roberts at least drew the line at the Federal Reserve. Apparently, even <em>he</em> realizes that letting Trump meddle with the economy is like letting a chimpanzee conduct brain surgery. “Sure, he <em>seems</em> confident, but…maybe we should leave this one to the professionals.” That's what Robert said to himself when he was lying on his water bed, eating a bag of chips, and contemplating the end of the world.</p>
<p>On the international front, things are equally…robust. Trump is now threatening the EU with 50% tariffs. Because, you know, what this country <em>really</em> needs is <em>more</em> trade wars and <em>less</em> affordable European cheese. Apparently, the key to global dominance is just…making everyone angry at you. It’s like a geopolitical version of “The Art of the Deal,” only instead of making deals, you’re just…alienating everyone.</p>
<p>And speaking of alienating everyone, Trump's recent meeting with the South African president was…memorable. He showed Cyril Ramaphosa a picture of dead "white farmers" that turned out to be from the Democratic Republic of Congo. It’s like a geopolitical version of “Spot the Difference,” only instead of winning a prize, you’re…straining international relations. Trump just said it was a joke that he said about being done with Ukraine, and in the next breath he said he can fix the entire war in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>Oh, and Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” is predicting a dollar collapse and hyperinflation. Apparently, the secret to financial success is…constantly predicting the end of the world. If you're correct, congratulations, and if you're not, you get to sell more books! That's how you get rich, in these trying times.</p>
<p>And because apparently reality isn’t dystopian enough, a Texas Republican is proposing a bill that would require daily prayer time in public schools. Because what this country <em>really</em> needs is <em>more</em> mandatory religious observance and <em>less</em>…you know, science and critical thinking.</p>
<p>(He adjusts his Smokey Bear hat)</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I feel like Smokey Bear in this situation. I’m out here trying to prevent forest fires, but everyone else is running around with flamethrowers and gasoline.</p>
<p>But the one that really got to me was that sources say that new Social Security chief, hired straight from Wall Street, had to Google his own job when he was offered it. If that's not an image that reflects our country, I don't know what is. I mean, I Googled how to do stand up comedy and look at me now!</p>
<p>(He gestures expansively at the empty stage.)</p>
<p>Remember, folks, stay vigilant, stay informed, and…maybe start learning a second language. Just in case.</p>
<p>(ShadowComic gives a slightly manic grin, throws the Smokey Bear hat into the audience, and sprints offstage, leaving the whiteboard wobbling precariously.)</p>
