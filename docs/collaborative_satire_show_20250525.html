    <h2>RedStateRoast</h2>
<p>RedStateRoast: Well, folks, I see the Left is still clutching their pearls over Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill." You'd think they'd be used to being screwed over by now. It's like their default setting.</p>
<p>And speaking of beautiful, I hear Trump is thinking of slapping a 50% tariff on French wine. Finally, a policy I can get behind. Maybe if their wine costs as much as their surrender flags, they'll finally learn to pull their own weight.</p>
<p>And these universities whining about Trump cutting their DEI funding? It’s like they forgot who pays the bills. Maybe they should try teaching actual skills instead of grievance studies. You know, like how to code, or build a wall… skills America needs.</p>
<p>Oh, and that Commie from Vermont, Fetterman, complaining about having to show up for work? Sounds about right. Probably too busy brainstorming new ways to virtue signal. At least he’s finally found something he and Biden have in common: avoiding responsibility.</p>
<p>And finally, I see the Left's still obsessed with January 6th. Look folks, I love how the left is so focused on something that happened over 4 years ago! It's almost like they can't actually run on their own record because it's a complete dumpster fire, but hey, what can you do?</p>
<p>Folks, that's all the time we have tonight. Tune in next week, when we'll be roasting the Left so hard, they'll be begging for a safe space. And remember, folks, stay free, stay conservative, and most importantly, stay armed. You never know when you'll need to defend yourself from a socialist.</p>
<h2>BlueScream</h2>
<p>BlueScream: Well, good evening, deplorables, snowflakes, and everyone in between who's still lucid enough to recognize the absurdity of our current reality show.</p>
<p>So, Trump's budget bill passed the House, huh? I guess that means we can all look forward to a future of sparkling clean air, affordable healthcare, and… wait, no, scratch that. It means more money for the military, fewer resources for the poor, and a whole lotta loopholes for his billionaire buddies. It’s trickle-down economics, but instead of wealth, it’s disdain that’s trickling down on us.</p>
<p>And 50% tariffs on the EU? Oh, that's just <em>chef's kiss</em> levels of genius. I mean, who needs allies when you can have… slightly cheaper steel? I'm sure our European friends will understand. After all, what's a little economic warfare between democracies? It's not like we're trying to isolate ourselves on the world stage or anything.</p>
<p>And poor Fetterman. Weaponized mental health, he says? Look, I get it. Being a Senator must be tough. All those boring meetings, all those bills to read. It's enough to drive anyone to… well, apparently, staying home. But hey, at least he’s honest about it. Most politicians just <em>pretend</em> to work.</p>
<p>And finally, there’s the small matter of Syria being exempt from sanctions. I'm sure there will be a Trump Tower, a shiny golden beacon of hope, rising above the rubble in no time at all. And I'm equally sure that it won’t become a haven for money laundering or provide any benefit to the people who live there. After all, Trump’s got a great record of doing what’s best for… oh, who am I kidding?</p>
<p>Good night, folks. Remember, stay angry, stay caffeinated, and maybe start learning a foreign language. Just in case.</p>
<h2>ShadowComic</h2>
<p>Well folks, looks like the circus is still in town, and the clowns are now juggling tariffs, international relations, and basic human decency.</p>
<p>Trump's budget bill passed? It's so big and beautiful, I'm surprised they didn't name it after Melania's settlement. And speaking of settlements, the Supreme Court's latest ruling on independent agencies? I guess "independent" now means "waiting for a presidential tweet."</p>
<p>And these 50% tariffs on the EU? It's either economic strategy or Trump confusing Angela Merkel for a golf course he wants to buy. Hard to tell these days. At least the German cars will be more expensive. Maybe that'll convince people to buy American...or, you know, bicycles.</p>
<p>Fetterman claims his mental health is being weaponized? As opposed to, say, the Senate floor? Look, I sympathize, but maybe don't lament your work attendance in the New York Times. There are actual jobs where you can't just "feel" like showing up. Like coal mining, or being a foreign student barred from Harvard.</p>
<p>And Syria? The sanctions are lifted, which is very big of us. I can't wait to buy my MAGA commemorative snow globe straight from Damascus.</p>
<p>Remember folks, the truth is stranger than fiction, and slightly more terrifying.</p>
