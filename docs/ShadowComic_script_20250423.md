Good evening. Or, as we now say in the People’s Republic of America, “Good Day to Our Glorious Leader’s Evening, Comrade.” It rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it? Like a freshly oiled… well, you get the idea.

So, another week, another… well, *that.* Remember when we thought four years was a long time? Turns out, it was just the extended trailer. Now we’re watching the director’s cut, complete with deleted scenes of democracy being slowly strangled by a tie made of gold braid.

I’ve been doing some… shall we say, *extensive* research into the administration’s latest initiatives. You know, for comedy. Because that’s what we’re still calling it. Research. Not, you know, compiling evidence for when the… *ahem*… regime collapses.

Turns out, the new Department of Truthiness is really pushing for “alternative facts” to be integrated into the national curriculum. History is being rewritten faster than you can say “fake news.” For instance, did you know that the Civil War was actually about state’s rights… to mandatory participation in the annual Mar-a-Lago golf tournament? Lincoln, a known Deep State operative, tried to interfere. Sad!

And speaking of education, Betsy DeVos – still somehow kicking – is back as Secretary of… well, whatever’s left of Education after they’ve finished defunding it. Her latest plan involves replacing textbooks with personalized holograms of the Dear Leader teaching… entrepreneurship. Apparently, the first lesson is how to successfully sue your way to the top. I'm taking notes.

The economy? Booming! At least, that’s what the official tweets tell us. Never mind the fact that the dollar is now backed by signed MAGA hats. Or that the unemployment rate only includes people who haven’t yet been conscripted into the new Patriot Guard, whose primary function is… well, let’s just say they’re very good at standing around and looking imposing. And surprisingly bad at crowd control.

Speaking of which, the 2028 election is shaping up to be… interesting. The Democratic nominee? A sentient AI chatbot programmed to appeal to the broadest possible demographic. Its platform? Universal basic avocado toast and a ban on Nickelback. Still polling ahead of the Republican challenger, Barron Trump’s cloned hamster, Mittens.

The Supreme Court, bless their black-robed hearts, just ruled that the First Amendment only applies to corporations with annual revenues exceeding the GDP of Luxembourg. Free speech is alive and well… if you can afford it.

But it’s not all doom and gloom, folks. There are glimmers of hope. The Resistance, for example, is thriving. It's mostly composed of grandmothers knitting subversive memes into sweaters and teenagers who’ve figured out how to hack the government’s propaganda bots to broadcast Rick Astley on repeat. It’s not much, but it’s honest work.

And then there’s the underground network of librarians smuggling banned books across state lines. They call themselves the “Bookleggers.” Apparently, they’re very good at hiding things in… well, let’s just say they’re employing some creative concealment techniques. Think “Little Women” meets “Narcos.”

The most popular contraband? A dusty copy of Orwell’s *1984*. The irony, as they say, is not lost on anyone. Except, perhaps, the people who need to understand it the most.

But let’s not dwell on the negative. Let’s focus on the positive. Like the fact that the White House is now painted entirely in gold leaf. It's very shiny. And very, very tacky. It's also, I hear, attracting a lot of pigeons. Which, in a way, is fitting.

And the new national anthem? A power ballad written by Kid Rock. It’s… well, it’s something. It involves a lot of eagles, beer, and thinly veiled threats against anyone who doesn’t stand and salute. I’m told it’s very popular at Klan rallies.

I almost forgot! The border wall is finally finished! It’s a magnificent structure. Impenetrable. Except, of course, for the tunnels being dug underneath it by a coalition of Mexican drug cartels and Canadian moose. They’re surprisingly resourceful.

But the best news of all? The Dear Leader is now accepting applications for his official biographer. The requirements? A complete lack of historical knowledge, a willingness to believe anything, and a strong stomach. I’m seriously considering applying. Think of the material!
