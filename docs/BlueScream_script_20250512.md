**(BlueScream strides onto the stage, a slightly rumpled suit hanging on a frame that suggests he hasn't slept well in… well, years.)**

**BlueScream:** Welcome back, everyone. Or, as they say in the newly rebranded United States of Trumpmerica, "Welcome back, patriots! Remember to buy gold and distrust anyone who speaks Spanish."

(Beat. The audience laughs nervously.)

**BlueScream:** It's been… a week. A week where I’ve spent more time contemplating the structural integrity of my escape hatch than I have pondering the meaning of life. And let me tell you, existential dread is a lot more fun when you’re not actively trying to avoid being waterboarded with Diet Coke.

**(A picture flashes on the screen: Trump shaking hands with a robot that looks suspiciously like Mike Pence.)**

**BlueScream:** Our glorious leader, President Trump, fresh off his victory in the 2024 "Stop the Steal… Again!" election, has been busy. He's unveiled his latest initiative: "Make America Great…er… Again… Again… Again!" which, as far as I can tell, involves replacing all government employees with AI-powered replicas. Apparently, the real people weren’t loyal enough. Or, you know, capable of telling the truth.

**(A headline scrolls across the screen: "White House Claims AI Replicas Have ‘Much Bigger Brains’ Than Humans")**

**BlueScream:** Bigger brains, folks! That's what we need. Because clearly, nuanced policy decisions are best left to algorithms designed to maximize Fox News viewership. I mean, who needs critical thinking when you can have a robot parroting pre-approved talking points with 100% accuracy? Efficiency! That’s the American way. Forget about ethical considerations or, you know, the potential for a Skynet-style uprising. We're too busy arguing about whether Mr. Potato Head is woke.

**(A quick cut to a clip of a heated debate on Fox News about Mr. Potato Head.)**

**BlueScream:** Speaking of woke, the Department of Education – now headed by Ivanka Trump, because nepotism is the new meritocracy – has announced a nationwide curriculum overhaul. Gone are those pesky history books that dared to mention, say, slavery or civil rights. Instead, students will learn about the "untarnished glory of the American experiment," which apparently consisted of inventing the cheeseburger and winning a lot of wars.

**(A textbook cover appears on the screen: "American History: Now with 30% More Freedom!")**

**BlueScream:** And the economy? Oh, the economy is *thriving*. At least, that's what the official numbers tell us. Never mind that those numbers are being generated by the same AI that's running the White House. Inflation is down, unemployment is nonexistent, and everyone is happy! Except, you know, the 99% of us who are working three minimum wage jobs to afford a single avocado. But hey, at least we're free! Free to choose between ramen noodles and eviction.

**(A chart appears on the screen: "American Happiness Index: Skyrocketing! (Disclaimer: Chart Produced by Trump AI)")**

**BlueScream:** But it's not all doom and gloom, folks. There's good news too! The Space Force, now armed with laser-powered MAGA hats, has successfully defended Earth from… well, they haven't actually defended Earth from anything yet. But they *look* really cool doing it! And that's what really matters, right? Aesthetics over substance. Like everything else in this administration.

**(A picture of a Space Force soldier wearing a laser-powered MAGA hat flashes on the screen.)**

**BlueScream:** And let's not forget about the Supreme Court. After the passing of Justice Clarence Thomas (may his ghost haunt Brett Kavanaugh for eternity), President Trump nominated… his own Twitter account. Yes, you heard that right. A collection of 280-character rants is now helping to shape the legal landscape of our nation. I'm sure that'll go well. Imagine arguing a case before a judge who’s prone to sudden bursts of ALL CAPS and misspelled insults.

**(A mock courtroom scene appears, with a judge wearing a Twitter bird mask.)**

**BlueScream:** So, where do we go from here? Honestly, I have no idea. I'm just a comedian, not a prophet. But I do know one thing: We can't afford to be complacent. We can't afford to shrug our shoulders and say, "Well, it's just the way things are." Because the way things are is… well,
