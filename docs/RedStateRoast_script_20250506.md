Good evening, patriots, and welcome back to “Truth Hurts, Snowflake.” I’m your host, RedStateRoast, here to sift through the dumpster fire of current events and find the few remaining nuggets of… well, let's call it "truth-adjacent" entertainment.

First up: The Supreme Court. Apparently, the left is STILL mad about our perfectly reasonable, Constitution-loving justices. They’re whining about “ethics” and “transparency.” As if knowing where a judge goes for dinner is going to change the fact that Roe v. Wade is deader than disco. These people think “ethics” means letting biological men compete in women’s sports. Newsflash: Real women don't have Adam's apples.

Speaking of which, remember when the Democrats were worried about the national debt? Good times. Now they’re pushing for universal basic income for… well, everyone. Apparently, working is now considered "oppressive." I guess pulling yourself up by your bootstraps is now a hate crime. Meanwhile, my neighbor’s kid, bless his heart, thinks Bitcoin is a personality trait.

And the border! Oh, the border. Biden's open-door policy was like a welcome mat for the world’s problems. Now that Trump is back, he's building a wall around the Democrats' safe spaces. I'm just kidding. Mostly. But seriously, the wall is going up, and the only thing coming across now are tumbleweeds and maybe a few confused coyotes. We're renaming it the "Liberal Tears Barrier" because, frankly, it's easier to say.

Have you seen what they’re teaching in schools these days? Critical Race Theory? More like Critical Race…Hysteria. They’re teaching our kids to hate America, hate themselves, and hate anyone who owns a pickup truck. I swear, if I hear one more kid tell me about “white privilege,” I’m going to explain to them the privilege of living in a country where you can complain about white privilege.

And don't even get me started on climate change. Apparently, cows are now the enemy of the planet. I'm pretty sure the carbon footprint of AOC's private jet is bigger than the entire state of Montana, but hey, who am I to judge? I'm just a guy who likes his steak medium-rare and his freedom well-done.

The media, of course, is having a field day. CNN is still trying to figure out how to report the news without crying, and MSNBC is convinced that Trump is secretly a Russian agent disguised as a golf course enthusiast. Meanwhile, Fox News is desperately trying to stay relevant by hiring a new generation of talking heads who are even more outraged than the last. It’s like a competition to see who can yell the loudest about nothing.

But here’s the thing: The American people are waking up. They’re tired of the woke nonsense, the virtue signaling, and the endless apologies for being American. They want a country where you can say “Merry Christmas” without being canceled, where you can own a gun without being labeled a terrorist, and where you can eat a hamburger without feeling guilty about the environment.

Remember free speech? It's endangered. Colleges are now echo chambers where only approved opinions are allowed. Try saying something conservative on campus, and you'll be treated like you just coughed up a lung during a plague outbreak. It's gotten so bad that even the professors are afraid to disagree with the mob.

And the entertainment industry? Hollywood is now a wasteland of reboots, remakes, and superhero movies. Originality is dead, and creativity is on life support. The only thing they seem to be good at is lecturing us about our moral failings. I'm pretty sure the irony is lost on them.

But hey, at least we have the Second Amendment. The left wants to take away our guns, but I say, let them try. I’m not saying we should start a revolution, but I am saying that a well-armed populace is a polite populace. Plus, how else am I going to protect my lawn from those pesky squirrels?

But you know what really gets me? The constant victimhood Olympics. Everyone is so eager to claim they’re the most oppressed group. It’s like a competition to see who can be the biggest snowflake. Meanwhile, the rest of us are just trying to live our lives, pay our taxes, and avoid getting canceled for accidentally misgendering a houseplant.

So, what’s the solution? Simple: Common sense. We need to stop listening to the professional complainers, the virtue signalers, and the woke warriors. We need to start focusing on what unites us, not what divides us. And we need to remember that America
