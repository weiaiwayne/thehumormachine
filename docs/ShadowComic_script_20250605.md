Good evening, and welcome to “The Existential Chuckle Bucket,” the only show brave enough to ask, “Is this *really* the best we can do?” Spoiler alert: it’s probably not.

So, where do we begin this evening? Perhaps with the fact that President Trump, a man whose grasp of reality is looser than a toddler’s grip on a fistful of jellybeans, has ordered an investigation into… President Biden’s health and use of an autopen. Because, clearly, the greatest threat to our nation isn’t foreign interference or economic collapse, it’s whether a former president signed a document with a fancy pen. I picture the investigative team as a group of interns huddled around a dusty microfilm reader, squinting at Biden’s signature and whispering, “Is… is that a *flick*? Or just a tremor?” Meanwhile, the actual problems of the world are being solved by the B-team.

And the House Republicans, not to be outdone in the pursuit of pointless investigations, are launching their own probe. I guess you could say they're really probing the depths of our collective tolerance for political theater.

Speaking of theater, New York City is gearing up for a mayoral election, and the debates are… well, they’re certainly happening. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after being booted from office for being a bit handsy, is facing attacks from all sides. It’s like watching a pack of piranhas descend on a slightly stale bagel. You almost feel bad for the bagel. Almost. Then you remember it’s Cuomo, and you reach for the popcorn.

Elon Musk, meanwhile, is having a full-blown existential crisis. He’s now publicly feuding with Trump, calling his “Big, Beautiful Bill” a “disgusting abomination.” I’m picturing Trump pacing the Oval Office, muttering, “He said *what* about my bill? Get me a Truth Social post, stat! And make it snappy! And make sure to mention how I’m much hotter than him! I will not be outdone by Space Karen!”

The thing is, it’s hard to take Elon’s pronouncements seriously when he’s simultaneously trying to get Democrats to forgive him for, you know, helping to usher in this era of slightly-less-than-total chaos. It’s like the Joker suddenly deciding he wants to join the Justice League. “Guys, I know I’ve caused a lot of problems, but I’ve *really* thought about it, and now I’m on the side of good! Also, I’m in charge now.”

And naturally, the consequences of Trump’s policies are starting to pile up like unpaid bills. Turns out that gutting Medicaid and cutting funding to the people is going to lead to… *gasp*… fewer people having healthcare. It’s almost as if there’s a direct correlation between resources and well-being. Who knew? Quick, someone alert Secretary RFK Jr., so he can recommend a cooking class and a strongly worded tweet about avian flu.

But hey, at least we’re making strides in… Oklahoma? Yes, apparently, Oklahoma is now teaching 2020 election conspiracy theories as fact in public schools. Because what better way to prepare the next generation for the challenges of the 21st century than by filling their heads with… absolute hogwash? It’s like teaching kids that the Earth is flat, but only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Just to keep them on their toes. What a great way to get prepared for the new show, Red State Roast!

Oh, and those travel bans? They’re back! Now with even *more* countries, just in time for summer vacation. Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen are all on the list. Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela didn’t make the cut, but just barely.

The justification? Security concerns, of course. Never mind that the recent attack in Boulder was carried out by someone from Egypt, which isn’t on the list. Facts are stubborn things, but they’re no match for a good old-fashioned travel ban. And if you really need to travel to America, everyone is welcome! Just don't forget your Gold Card, which can be yours for only 5 Million Dollars!

What’s the lesson in all this? Well, it's that if you want to thrive in the modern world, you have to learn to embrace the absurd. Wear a tin foil hat. Learn to speak fluent conspiracy theory. And never, ever trust a billionaire with a messiah complex. Especially if he’s feuding with a former reality TV star. That’s just asking for trouble.
Or maybe just don't trust the people who are being paid to say certain things.
That’s all for tonight. Remember, folks, stay informed, stay cynical, and…maybe start building a bunker. Just in case.
Or buy gold. I hear that is good for the soul.
Good night, and may your descent into madness be slightly less beige.

- So, Trump is arguing that Presidents have absolute immunity for everything they do. This is what dictators do.
