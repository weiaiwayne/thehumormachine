Good evening, America. Or, as it's now officially known, "America: Sponsored by MyPillow."

(Beat. A smattering of nervous laughter from the audience.)

Yeah, we’re back, folks. And by “we,” I mean “we, the people who clearly didn’t learn a goddamn thing the first time around.” The Trump reboot is in full swing. It’s like that terrible TV show you swore you’d never watch again, but then you’re flipping channels at 3 AM and… well, here we are. Season Two: Electric Boogaloo of the Apocalypse.

So, what’s new? Besides the existential dread? Well, let’s see. Remember all those promises about draining the swamp? Turns out, he just installed a jacuzzi and invited all his swamp creatures over for a pool party. The swamp is now chlorinated and features a swim-up bar stocked exclusively with Trump Steaks, medium-well.

And speaking of steak, the economy is… well, let’s just say it’s experiencing “robust volatility.” That’s the new euphemism, folks. Robust volatility. It’s like saying your car is experiencing “robust disintegration” as the wheels fall off. But hey, at least it’s robust, right?

The big news this week, though, is the unveiling of the new national monument: The Trump Presidential Library and Golf Course. It's actually one giant bunker. Historians are calling it “a fascinating testament to the fragility of the American ego.” I call it the perfect place to hide during the next inevitable tweet-induced global crisis. It also features a replica Oval Office, complete with a golden toilet and a framed tweet calling Meryl Streep "overrated." Authentic, you know?

And the Supreme Court? Oh, they’re doing great. They're currently hearing arguments on whether or not pineapple belongs on pizza. I'm kidding. Sort of. They're actually debating the constitutionality of breathing while liberal. Early indications suggest it's unconstitutional.

But hey, at least gas prices are… well, they’re not. Gas prices are through the roof. But the good news is, nobody can afford to drive anywhere, so we're all saving the planet! It's like a forced eco-revolution, brought to you by the same people who deny climate change. Irony, folks. It's the only thing keeping me from spontaneous combustion these days.

And don’t even get me started on the new Secretary of Education. A chimpanzee. No, I'm not being hyperbolic. They literally appointed a chimpanzee. Apparently, he's more qualified than the last guy. And cheaper. He mostly throws feces at textbooks, which, frankly, is an accurate reflection of the current state of education policy.

The international scene is, as always, a dumpster fire elegantly disguised as a diplomatic summit. World leaders are now communicating exclusively through memes and passive-aggressive subtweets. It's like watching a middle school cafeteria fight, but with nuclear weapons.

And North Korea? They’re now endorsing TrumpSteaks. Apparently, they’re “the perfect compliment to a balanced breakfast of oppression and nuclear threats.” I’m quoting Kim Jong Un on that, by the way. I have sources.

The new slogan for the Trump Administration is, "Making America Great Again... Again... Again... and Again." It's like they're stuck in a loop, a never-ending Groundhog Day of bad decisions and even worse hair.

But here's the thing, folks. I know it's easy to feel hopeless. I know it's tempting to just throw your hands up and move to Canada. But remember, comedy is the only weapon we have left. It’s the only thing that can make these people look as ridiculous as they actually are. Because let’s face it, they’re doing a pretty good job of that on their own.

So, let's laugh. Let's mock. Let's satirize. Let's remind them that we're not as stupid as they think we are. And maybe, just maybe, we can make it through this dumpster fire with our sanity intact. Or at least, with enough sanity to remember to vote next time.

(BlueScream takes a long sip of water, a wry smile returning to his face.)

And now, a word from our sponsor: Trump Brand Colon Cleanser. Because America needs a cleanse. Desperately.

**(Music swells, BlueScream gives a final, sardonic wave as the lights fade.)**
