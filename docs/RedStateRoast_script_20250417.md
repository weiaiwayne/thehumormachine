Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. Welcome back to "Truth Hurts," the only show brave enough to say what you’re all thinking… or at least what you *should* be thinking.

Another week, another avalanche of ridiculousness. Where do we even begin? Oh, I know! Remember when the Left swore up and down that Trump was going to start World War III? Turns out, he just needed a second term to negotiate a killer deal on… wait for it… Venezuelan oil. Yeah, that’s right. Turns out the best way to stick it to Putin is to buy oil from a guy who makes Putin look like a kindergarten teacher. Genius! I mean, who needs the Keystone pipeline when you can just cut a check to Maduro? It’s like laundering money, but with crude oil and a side of international embarrassment.

And speaking of embarrassment, did you see the latest from the Department of Education? They're proposing a new curriculum: "Woke-Free History: The Real Story of America, Minus All the Bad Stuff." Apparently, slavery was just a "complex labor situation" and the Civil Rights Movement was a "minor disagreement." I’m kidding… mostly. The official statement is “Nuanced.” Because apparently, nuance is what we need when discussing the systematic oppression of millions. Honestly, I’m waiting for the companion course: "Advanced Gaslighting for Young Patriots."

But hey, at least the economy is… well, it's *something*. Inflation is still higher than Hunter Biden on a Tuesday, but the President assures us it’s “transitory.” Just like his promises to build that wall, right? Remember that wall? Now we’re building a virtual wall in the metaverse. Apparently, illegal immigrants are now crossing the border via Oculus Rift. Progress, folks!

And let’s not forget about the cultural landscape. Hollywood is still churning out woke garbage faster than you can say “cancel culture.” The latest superhero movie features a non-binary, pansexual, vegan superhero who fights climate change with the power of… interpretive dance. I’m not making this up. I saw the trailer. I think. I might have hallucinated it after accidentally watching CNN for five minutes.

But fear not, patriots! There is a beacon of hope shining in the darkness: the return of the McRib. That’s right, folks! The pinnacle of culinary artistry is back on the menu. Finally, something to unite this divided nation. Except, of course, the McRib is now made with lab-grown meat and costs $27.99. So much for affordable comfort food.

And the Democrats? Oh, they're still doing... whatever it is they do. They've rebranded again, this time as the "Party of Common Sense." I know, I choked on my Diet Coke, too. Last I checked, their common sense involved defunding the police and giving free college to everyone who can fog a mirror. But hey, maybe this time they’ll actually figure out how to win an election without cheating… I mean, without “fortifying the vote.”

Speaking of elections, the midterms are coming up fast. Get ready for another round of accusations, conspiracy theories, and recounts that drag on longer than a Lizzo concert. I'm already practicing my "Stop the Steal… Again!" chants.

But you know what really gets me? The hypocrisy. The Left is constantly lecturing us about tolerance and inclusivity, but the moment you disagree with them, you're a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a climate change denier, and possibly a Russian agent. It's exhausting. I mean, can't we just disagree without being called names? Apparently not.

And the Right isn't exactly blameless either. We're so busy fighting the culture war that we're forgetting about things like, you know, balancing the budget and securing the border. We’re so busy owning the libs that we’re letting them bankrupt the country.

But hey, at least we have memes. And that’s what really matters, right? As long as we can make fun of each other on the internet, everything will be fine. Right? Right?

**(He stares blankly at the audience for a beat.)**

Okay, maybe not. But at least we can laugh about it. Because if we don’t laugh, we’ll cry. And nobody wants to see a grown man in a bolo tie cry.

So, until next week, stay vigilant, stay informed, and for the
