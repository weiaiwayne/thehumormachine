Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. I see the virtue-signaling squad is in full force tonight. Don’t worry, I brought enough freedom to share.

So, I took a deep dive into the cesspool of sanity that is Reddit today. You know, for research. Turns out, America's still America, just with more pronouns and less gasoline.

First up, apparently, the Department of Homeland Security is now offering sensitivity training... to illegal aliens. Yeah, you heard me right. We're teaching the people who broke our laws how to feel bad about *our* feelings. I'm picturing a PowerPoint presentation with slides like, “Microaggressions: When Asking for Free Healthcare is Considered Rude.” Followed by a group activity: "Sharing Circle: Tell Us Your Grievances Against the Country You Illegally Entered." This is taxpayer money hard at work, folks. Makes you proud to be American, doesn't it?

And speaking of illegal immigration, Kamala Harris just announced a new plan to solve the border crisis. She's gonna hold a series of "listening sessions" with... wait for it... TikTok influencers. Apparently, the key to securing our border is viral dance challenges and lip-syncing about the importance of open borders. I'm sure El Chapo is shaking in his boots. Maybe if we get Charli D'Amelio to do a TikTok about the dangers of fentanyl, the cartels will just pack up and go home. Problem solved!

Then there's this gem: The Pentagon is now offering gender-affirming care… for dolphins. Yes, you read that correctly. Apparently, Flipper has been feeling a little…flounder-y lately. I’m guessing it involves a lot of seaweed wraps and existential angst. I’m not sure how you surgically alter a dolphin's…well, anything. But hey, if we can spend trillions on wars we can’t win, why not spend a few million on dolphin transitioning? It’s all about inclusivity, people. I just hope they don't start demanding pronouns. I can see it now: "He/She/Echolocation."

And don’t even get me started on the latest woke outrage. Apparently, the new M&M’s are now…too sexy. Yeah, the candy mascots. Too sexy. The green one is apparently too…empowered? I don’t know. All I know is that I miss the days when my biggest problem was whether to eat the red one first. Now, I have to worry about whether my candy is contributing to the patriarchy. I tell you, folks, the left can find something to be offended by in a blank piece of paper.

Oh, and remember that time the UN declared that access to the internet was a human right? Well, they've upped the ante. Now, they're saying that access to free Wi-Fi is a fundamental human right. I’m waiting for them to declare that Netflix and chill is a constitutional amendment. I mean, why work when you can just binge-watch "Squid Game" and complain about capitalism on Twitter?

Speaking of work, our esteemed Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, just unveiled his plan to fix the national supply chain crisis. He's going to hold a series of…wait for it…knitting circles with longshoremen. Yes, knitting. Apparently, the key to unclogging our ports is a well-knitted scarf. I'm picturing a bunch of burly guys with beards, sipping tea and talking about gauge tension while waiting for the cargo ships to unload. It’s a beautiful image, really. Almost as beautiful as the thought of America becoming a global laughingstock.

And let's not forget about our universities. Yale University just announced a new course: "The History of Wokeness: From Socrates to Social Justice Warriors." I’m pretty sure Socrates would be spinning in his grave if he knew he was being associated with…well, anything that comes out of Yale these days. I suspect the course will be taught entirely in safe spaces, with trigger warnings for historical facts and mandatory pronoun checks before every lecture. I wonder if extra credit will be given for crying during the reading of critical race theory literature.

And finally, the most shocking news of the day: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just announced she's running for president… of Mars. Apparently, she believes that the red planet is the perfect place to implement her Green New Deal. I’m not sure how you’re going to power a socialist utopia on solar energy when you’re millions of miles from the sun, but hey, anything is possible with enough government
