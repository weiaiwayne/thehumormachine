Good evening, patriots, snowflakes, and everyone in between. Or, as Biden calls you, "folks." I'm RedStateRoast, here to sift through today’s dumpster fire of news so you don't have to. Consider it a public service… mostly for me, because my therapist bills are astronomical.

First up, and you knew this was coming, the economy. Remember when inflation was "transitory"? Yeah, turns out "transitory" is Latin for "until Biden's term ends." Gas prices are so high, I saw a guy siphoning gas from a Prius. Talk about desperation. And the Fed keeps raising interest rates. It's like they're trying to cure a hangover with a hammer. Good luck with that, Jerome.

But hey, at least we're tackling the real issues, right? I mean, who needs affordable groceries when you can have…checks notes… another gender studies program at your local university? Apparently, "man," "woman," and "common sense" are now considered hate speech. Meanwhile, I'm pretty sure my dog identifies as someone who deserves a treat every five minutes. And you know what? He's probably right. He contributes more to society than half the TikTok influencers.

Speaking of influencers, did you see the latest climate change protest? They glued themselves to a Van Gogh painting. I’m not saying they’re not passionate, but maybe try gluing yourself to a politician who actually makes decisions instead of defacing priceless art. Though, honestly, maybe Van Gogh would appreciate the irony. He probably felt like his life was glued to a garbage can too. Plus, it's a great way to get your art in the news!

Oh, and the border. Still a sieve. I saw a headline that said, "Border Patrol overwhelmed by influx of migrants." Overwhelmed? They’re practically throwing open the gates and handing out "Welcome to America" pamphlets. I bet even Ellis Island is saying, "Whoa, hold up, slow down a bit." At this point, building a wall is less about keeping people out and more about giving construction workers something to do.

And let's not forget our esteemed Vice President, Kamala Harris. She's been tasked with solving the… checks notes again… root causes of migration. You know, like poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity. So, basically, she's going to fix the entire developing world. Good luck with that, Kamala. I’m pretty sure the last thing she “fixed” was a soundbite. Maybe she should start by fixing the root causes of her own incoherent speeches.

But it's not all doom and gloom, folks. There's still hope! I mean, at least… uh… well, there's… Okay, I'm drawing a blank. Maybe hope is just another "transitory" thing.

Oh, wait! I got one. Remember that whole Hunter Biden laptop saga? Turns out, it was real! Who knew? Everyone, that's who. But now the mainstream media is finally admitting it. It's like they just discovered fire. Next thing you know, they'll be reporting that water is wet and the sun rises in the east. Though, knowing them, they'll probably try to spin it as a victory for diversity and inclusion. "Hunter Biden's laptop: A celebration of alternative lifestyles and the beauty of digital art!"

And speaking of the Bidens, remember when Joe promised to unite the country? Yeah, about that. I think he’s united everyone in the shared experience of wondering what he’s going to say next. It's like watching a magic show where the magician clearly has no idea what he's doing, but you’re too polite to say anything.

But hey, at least he's not tweeting at 3 a.m. That's progress, right? Although, sometimes I wonder if a few coherent 3 a.m. tweets wouldn't be an improvement.

And finally, the woke mob is at it again. This time, they're coming for…checks notes one last time… Thanksgiving. Apparently, it's a celebration of colonialism and genocide. You know, because nothing says "genocide" like a giant turkey and pumpkin pie. Look, I get it. History is complicated. But maybe, just maybe, we can enjoy a day of gratitude without feeling the need to rewrite the entire narrative of the country. Or, at the very least, without having to apologize to our ancestors for eating too much stuffing.

So, there you have it, folks. Another day, another dose of insanity. Remember to stay informed, stay vigilant, and, most
