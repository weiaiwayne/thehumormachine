Good evening, everyone. Or, as CNN would say, good evening, *people who identify as having an evening*. I'm RedStateRoast, and tonight, we're diving headfirst into the glorious dumpster fire that is modern discourse.

First up, Reddit. Ah, Reddit. The internet’s collective subconscious, where logic goes to die a slow, agonizing death by a thousand upvotes. I was browsing the "Am I the Asshole" subreddit earlier, and I swear, I’m starting to believe that the entire platform is just a sophisticated Turing test designed to prove that humanity is, in fact, already extinct.

One gem: A vegan demanded that her carnivore boyfriend stop breathing near her kale smoothies. Apparently, the sheer scent of bacon was triggering her post-traumatic stress from... enjoying a perfectly cooked BLT before she saw the light. Look, I'm all for personal choices, but if the smell of a delicious pork product causes you existential dread, maybe the problem isn’t the bacon. Maybe it’s your therapist. And your life choices. Possibly both.

And speaking of choices, I saw another post about a guy who wants to change his name to "X Æ A-12," after Elon Musk's kid. He says it’s a tribute to innovation. I say it’s a tribute to the fact that he clearly peaked in middle school and is now desperately seeking attention in the most embarrassing way possible. I mean, come on. "X Æ A-12"? You’re going to fill out a job application with that? Good luck explaining that to HR, buddy. You’ll be lucky if they don't flag you as a bot. And honestly, at that point, you might *be* a bot.

Then there was a thread debating whether it's morally acceptable to eat a goldfish if it dies of natural causes. Natural causes! We're talking about a goldfish, people! We’ve reached a point where we need to consult the internet about the ethics of consuming a pet that lives in a plastic castle and has a memory span of three seconds. I'm starting to think we need to start funding common sense initiatives, alongside the "go green" movement. "Go Sane", if you will.

But Reddit isn't just about existential crises and questionable culinary choices. No, it’s also a hotbed of political insight. I stumbled upon a thread where someone argued that capitalism is inherently evil because Starbucks once charged them extra for an oat milk latte. I mean, the logic is irrefutable. It's right up there with arguing that the French Revolution was sparked by a bad croissant.

And don't even get me started on the echo chambers. You know you've hit peak Reddit when you find a subreddit dedicated to hating people who use Comic Sans font. It’s like, guys, there are actual problems in the world. I'm pretty sure the geopolitical landscape is more pressing than your font preferences. But hey, at least they’re passionate about something. Even if that something is objectively ridiculous.

Oh, and I almost forgot. There was a whole debate on whether pineapple belongs on pizza. I mean, come on, folks. We've got wars raging, economies collapsing, and the impending threat of AI overlords, and we're arguing about *pineapple*? The answer, by the way, is no. It’s an abomination. It’s culinary treason. It’s the reason aliens won’t talk to us.

And speaking of things that don’t belong, I saw a thread advocating for mandatory participation trophies for adults. The logic? It would boost self-esteem and reduce societal anxiety. Right, because what we really need is a generation of adults who think they're special just for showing up. I can already picture the job interviews: "Why should we hire you?" "Well, I showed up, so... trophy?"

Look, I'm not saying Reddit is entirely devoid of value. Sometimes, you can find a decent recipe or a helpful DIY guide. But most of the time, it’s just a reminder that the internet was a mistake. A glorious, hilarious, and utterly terrifying mistake.

So, the next time you're feeling down about the state of the world, just remember: there’s always Reddit. A place where the absurd becomes the norm, and the only thing more plentiful than opinions are people who are absolutely convinced they're right. And maybe, just maybe, that’s the most comforting thought of all.

Good night, and remember: Don
