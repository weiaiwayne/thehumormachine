Good evening, patriots, and welcome back to “Unfiltered Truthiness,” the only show brave enough to say what you’re thinking…after a stiff drink and a thorough review of the latest executive orders.

Speaking of executive orders, did you see the one this week? Mandatory American flag Speedos for all Pride parades. Apparently, the President feels we need to "Make Pride Patriotic Again." I, for one, am all for it. Nothing screams tolerance like forcing people to express it in swimwear they probably wouldn't be caught dead in otherwise. The ACLU is already filing suit, naturally. I say, let them. It's a great opportunity to see some lawyers in Speedos. Win-win.

And how about this climate change nonsense? The scientists are still whining, even after President Trump personally negotiated a new climate accord with the sun. Terms are confidential, but I hear it involves a significant reduction in solar flares in exchange for a lifetime supply of tanning lotion. Seems reasonable to me. Besides, what's a little global warming when you've got a great tan?

The media, of course, is having a meltdown. CNN is reporting that the sun is “uncooperative” and “potentially colluding” with the administration. MSNBC is claiming the tanning lotion is a Russian asset. Honestly, you can’t make this stuff up. Well, I can, but they’re already doing it.

And let's talk about the economy. Booming! Absolutely booming! GDP is up, unemployment is down, and inflation is…well, let’s just say it’s “experiencing a period of dynamic growth.” Okay, fine, inflation is through the roof. But at least it’s *American* inflation. We’re paying more for everything, but we’re doing it with pride. And besides, who needs to buy anything when you can just look at pictures of the President’s golf course? It’s basically economic porn.

The Democrats, predictably, are blaming everything on Trump. They say his tax cuts for the rich are responsible for the rising cost of…everything. They say he’s destroying the environment. They say he’s undermining democracy. Honestly, you’d think they’d be used to it by now. It's been six years.

But here’s the kicker. They’re still trying to impeach him. Again. This time, it’s for “crimes against good taste” after he replaced the Mona Lisa with a portrait of himself eating a cheeseburger. I mean, it’s tacky, sure. But is it impeachable? I’m not a lawyer, but I’m pretty sure the Constitution doesn’t say anything about “aesthetic offenses.” Although, maybe it should. Some of the fashion choices on Capitol Hill are definitely impeachable.

Speaking of Capitol Hill, remember that whole “Defund the Police” movement? Yeah, that’s going great. Crime is down… in gated communities. Everywhere else, it’s like a real-life version of "The Purge," only instead of one night, it’s every Tuesday. But hey, at least we’re having an important conversation about social justice…while we’re barricading our doors.

And the universities? Oh, don’t even get me started. They’re still churning out snowflakes faster than Hallmark can produce Christmas movies. Apparently, trigger warnings are now mandatory for everything, including the Pledge of Allegiance. You know, because saying “under God” might offend someone who doesn’t believe in God. Or someone who’s allergic to the word “God.” Honestly, at this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if they started requiring trigger warnings for the word “trigger.”

But the best part? They’re teaching kids that America is inherently evil. That everything we’ve ever done is rooted in racism and oppression. That the Founding Fathers were just a bunch of slave-owning white supremacists. I mean, come on. They also invented the cheeseburger. Give them some credit.

And don’t even get me started on social media. It’s a cesspool of virtue signaling, cancel culture, and cat videos. You can’t even express a mildly conservative opinion without getting bombarded with death threats and accusations of being a Nazi. Unless, of course, you're on Truth Social. Then you just get bombarded with pictures of the President eating cheeseburgers.

But hey, at least we have freedom of speech, right? Well, sort of. As long as you agree with the prevailing narrative. Otherwise, you’re a “misinformation spreader” and your account gets shadow banned. It’s like living in a communist country, only with better Wi-Fi.

Look, I know things are crazy. But let’s be honest
