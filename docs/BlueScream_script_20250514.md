**(Open on BlueScream at his desk, a single spotlight illuminating him against a backdrop of swirling, slightly glitchy, American flags. He’s dressed in a crisp, slightly rumpled suit, a knowing smirk playing on his lips.)**

BlueScream: Welcome back, folks. Welcome to the slow-motion apocalypse. Or, as the White House is now calling it, "Operation: MAGA 2.0: Electric Boogaloo." Because apparently, we didn't learn our lesson the first time around.

(He gestures vaguely towards the flag backdrop.)

And speaking of lessons, remember civics class? Remember learning about checks and balances, the separation of powers, the sacred sanctity of the Constitution? Yeah, well, turns out that was just performance art. A really elaborate, expensive, and ultimately pointless piece of performance art. The kind where you pay a fortune to watch someone slowly peel an orange for three hours.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. “BlueScream, you’re being hyperbolic. It can’t be *that* bad.” And you’d be right. It’s worse. It’s like discovering your favorite ice cream flavor is now made with recycled socks and existential dread.

(He picks up a tablet, scrolls through it with a disdainful look.)

Let's dive into the dumpster fire of the week, shall we? This week’s headliner: The President’s new initiative to "Make America Read Good Again." And no, that's not a typo. It's the actual slogan. Apparently, someone finally showed him the comments section on his Truth Social account. The horror.

The plan, as far as anyone can decipher from the rambling press release written entirely in Comic Sans, involves replacing all books in public schools with copies of “The Art of the Deal” and a newly ghostwritten biography titled "Trump: The Man Who Single-Handedly Invented Breathing."

(He raises an eyebrow.)

I'm not sure which is more terrifying: the blatant propaganda or the fact that someone actually agreed to ghostwrite that biography. I'm guessing it was Rudy Giuliani. He needs the money. Probably to pay off the parrot he hired to testify on his behalf.

But wait, there's more! To ensure that no subversive ideas sneak into the classroom, all teachers will be required to undergo mandatory "Patriotism Training" which, according to sources, involves reciting the Pledge of Allegiance while simultaneously balancing a stack of MAGA hats on their heads. Failure to maintain hat equilibrium results in mandatory re-education at a "Freedom Camp." I'm not even kidding. Freedom Camp. It sounds like a summer camp for toddlers with totalitarian tendencies.

And speaking of education, Congress just passed a bill redefining "critical race theory" as anything that makes white people feel uncomfortable. So, history. Basically, history is now illegal. Time to burn those pesky textbooks.

(He sighs dramatically.)

You know, I used to think the biggest threat to democracy was apathy. Turns out, it's enthusiastic incompetence. It's like watching a toddler play with a loaded bazooka. You know it's going to end badly, you just don't know *how* badly.

But hey, at least the economy is booming, right? Well, sort of. It’s booming for the top 0.001%. For the rest of us, it's more like a gentle, persistent drizzle of economic anxiety. Inflation is still higher than Snoop Dogg at a Phish concert. And the national debt? Let’s just say it’s bigger than Trump’s ego.

(He leans forward conspiratorially.)

But don't worry, the administration has a plan to fix the debt. They're selling off national parks to private developers. Apparently, Yosemite is going to be a Trump-branded golf course and Mar-a-Lago West. It’s truly inspiring.

And the Supreme Court? Oh, the Supreme Court. They’re still busy overturning precedents faster than I can change my socks. Apparently, stare decisis is now just a suggestion. Like flossing. Or wearing pants in public.

(He pauses, takes a sip of water.)

Look, I know this is depressing. I know it feels like we're trapped in a never-ending episode of "The Twilight Zone" directed by a reality TV producer with a penchant for spray tans. But don't lose hope. Don't give up. Because if we don't laugh, we'll cry. And I'm all out of tissues.

Besides, who knows? Maybe, just maybe, this is all part of some grand cosmic plan. Maybe the universe is just testing us. Maybe it's trying to see how much absurdity we can tolerate before we finally snap and start demanding common sense.

Or maybe, the universe is just a nihil
