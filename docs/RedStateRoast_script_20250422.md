Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. Welcome back to "Truth Bombs & Tactical Nukes," the only show brave enough to tell you what you *really* think, even if you're too terrified to admit it to your spouse.

So, another week, another dumpster fire of liberal tears. This time, they're weeping over…checks notes… the re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-instatement of the Trump University School of Applied Brilliance as a fully accredited, degree-granting institution.

I know, I know, you're shocked. You thought the Left had purged all vestiges of common sense and fiscal responsibility from our education system. But fear not, patriots! Now your kids can learn valuable skills like… how to negotiate a killer real estate deal while simultaneously tweeting insults at Rosie O’Donnell. It’s a practical skill set, people! Just ask the President.

And speaking of the President, his latest executive order is a real head-scratcher. He's mandated that all public school history textbooks now include a chapter dedicated to… the time he single-handedly rescued a bald eagle from a rogue windmill. Apparently, the original story – the one about him wrestling a bear for the right to sell MAGA hats – was deemed "too unbelievable." Even for *him*.

Honestly, I’m starting to think the guy’s losing it. Just yesterday, he held a press conference to announce his new plan to… build a wall… *around* California. His reasoning? "To contain the crazy." I mean, he’s not *wrong*. But last I checked, walls were for keeping people *out*, not in. Unless, of course, he’s planning on turning California into America’s progressive petting zoo. A place where we can all go to marvel at gender studies majors and vegan cheese factories from a safe distance.

And the Supreme Court! Bless their black-robed hearts. They’ve finally ruled on the landmark case of *Kramer vs. Kramer*, a lawsuit brought by… well, Kramer. Apparently, he’s been trying to sue the producers of “Seinfeld” for years, claiming they stole his likeness. The court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled that Kramer… is, in fact, “a real person and a national treasure.” The dissenting justices, all appointed by Democrat presidents, argued that Kramer was “a menace to society” and “should be deported back to the 1990s.”

Of course, the Left is predictably outraged. They’re calling it a “travesty of justice” and a “blow to the very fabric of our democracy.” I say, lighten up, liberals! It’s just Kramer! What’s the worst that could happen? He accidentally starts a fire in the Supreme Court library? He tries to sell the justices a bunch of outdated VCRs? He starts a cockfighting ring in the court’s basement?

Okay, maybe that last one *is* a little concerning.

But the real story this week is the ongoing debate over… pronouns. Apparently, people are still confused about whether they should call someone “he,” “she,” or… whatever the latest iteration of the alphabet soup is. The President, in his infinite wisdom, has issued an executive order declaring that the official pronouns of the United States are now “Sir” and “Madam.” Anyone caught using anything else will be… forced to watch CNN for 24 hours straight. It’s cruel and unusual punishment, I know, but sometimes you have to fight fire with… mind-numbing, soul-crushing liberal propaganda.

The Left, naturally, is having a collective meltdown. They’re claiming the President is “erasing” trans people and “denying their existence.” I say, if you’re so easily erased, maybe you shouldn’t have built your entire identity around a made-up word. Just a thought.

And finally, let's talk about the economy. Inflation is still soaring. Gas prices are still astronomical. And the only thing growing faster than the national debt is… Kamala Harris’s collection of ill-fitting pantsuits. But hey, at least we’re not in a recession! According to the White House, we’re actually experiencing a period of “dynamic economic recalibration.” Which, as far as I can tell, is just a fancy way of saying, “We’re broke, but at least we’re using big words!”

But don’t despair, patriots! There’s always hope. As long as we continue to stand up for our values, fight back against the woke mob,
