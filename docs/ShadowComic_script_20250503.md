Good evening, patriots. Or, as they’re now officially calling us, “Participants in the Glorious Re-Education Program.” I’m ShadowComic, still here, still breathing, still… employed. Barely.

So, another week in the… *United* States of America. Emphasis on the *united*, of course. Like a freshly glued-together vase after a particularly nasty family argument. You can see the cracks, but hey, at least the flowers are still vaguely upright.

Speaking of flowers, Melania unveiled the new White House Rose Garden this week. Apparently, it’s now entirely comprised of genetically modified MAGA roses. They’re bright orange, aggressively thorny, and only bloom when you shout “Fake News!” at them. Symbolism, people. It’s like a punch to the gut, but with pollen.

And the President? Oh, he’s doing great. Tremendous. He just signed an executive order renaming Mondays to “Make America Great Again Day.” Tuesdays are now “Totally Terrific Trump Tuesdays.” Wednesdays… well, Wednesdays are still Wednesdays. Even dictators have limits. Apparently.

They’re saying the economy is booming. Booming like a poorly timed firework at a funeral. Unemployment is at an all-time low… if you don’t count the journalists, academics, and anyone who ever uttered the words “alternative fact.” They’re all… *doing* something. I’m sure.

I saw a statistic the other day. 98% of Americans now own at least one piece of Trump-branded merchandise. The other 2% are either in hiding or living off-grid, communicating solely through carrier pigeons trained to recognize the phrase “Resist.” Good luck finding those pigeons, by the way. The Department of Homeland Security is *very* interested in avian intelligence these days.

Speaking of intelligence, the Secretary of Education announced a new national curriculum. It’s based entirely on the President’s Twitter feed. History, civics, astrophysics… all filtered through 280 characters of pure, unadulterated genius. I’ve already started memorizing my favorite tweets. “Covfefe: A Philosophical Exploration” is going to be a real page-turner.

And the Supreme Court? Let’s just say they’re keeping busy. They’re currently hearing a case that argues the President should be allowed to pardon himself… preemptively. It’s like buying flood insurance *after* the dam has already burst. Brilliant!

But hey, at least the infrastructure is improving. They’re building a beautiful, impenetrable wall… around Mar-a-Lago. Because, you know, national security. Makes perfect sense.

I saw a protest the other day. Small, but spirited. They were chanting slogans, holding signs… mostly about free speech. A noble cause. The Secret Service politely asked them to relocate to the designated “Free Speech Zone.” Which is, of course, a small, fenced-in area located directly beneath the flight path of Air Force One. Very convenient.

They’re also cracking down on misinformation. Which is ironic, considering… well, you know. They’ve established a new Ministry of Truth. It’s staffed entirely by AI bots programmed to detect and eliminate “unpatriotic thoughts.” I’ve already started practicing my poker face. It’s getting… quite the workout.

But don't worry, folks. There’s still hope. I overheard a conversation at Starbucks the other day. Two baristas were discussing… something. It was coded, cryptic, possibly revolutionary. I couldn’t quite make it out, but I’m pretty sure they were ordering a venti latte with extra… *something*. The resistance lives!

And speaking of resistance, they’ve started offering tax credits for families who name their children after prominent dissidents. I’m expecting a surge in babies named “Ruth Bader Ginsburg” any day now.

They also announced a new reality TV show: “The Apprentice: Supreme Court Edition.” The contestants are all aspiring judges vying for a lifetime appointment. The challenges include writing dissenting opinions in crayon and correctly identifying the President’s favorite flavor of ice cream. The winner gets to sit next to Clarence Thomas for the next 40 years. Riveting television.

I heard they're also working on a new national anthem. It's a remix of "God Bless America" and the sound of a cash register. Catchy, isn't it?

Look, I'm not saying things are perfect. Far from it. But we're Americans. We're resilient. We're… well, we’re still here. And as long as we can still laugh, even a nervous, slightly terrified laugh, they haven
