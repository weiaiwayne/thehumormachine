Good evening, patriots. Or, as they’re now officially known, “Trump Loyalty Card Holders.” Welcome back to “Truthiness: Unfiltered,” the only show still legally allowed to use the word “unfiltered.” Mostly because it’s become synonymous with “sewage.”

So, another week, another… reality. I’m told that’s what we’re still calling this era. “Reality.” A quaint term, like “democracy” or “critical thinking.” Remember those?

First things first, let’s give a round of applause to our fearless leader, Donald J. Trump, for successfully negotiating the peace treaty with… himself. Apparently, the internal war raging within his psyche was costing the nation billions in therapy bills. The deal, brokered by Rudy Giuliani (who, against all odds, is still technically a lawyer, albeit one who argues exclusively in bird law), stipulates that both sides agree to refer to each other as “tremendous” and “very, very smart.” Details on the concessions made by each side are, understandably, classified. National security, you know. Can't have the world knowing the extent of the internal turmoil.

And speaking of classified, the newly appointed Secretary of Redactions, Kimberly Guilfoyle, has announced a bold initiative to streamline the government’s transparency efforts. From now on, all government documents will be pre-redacted. Saves time, saves money, saves us from accidentally learning something. Think of it as proactive opacity. It’s brilliant, really. Imagine, no more pesky journalists filing Freedom of Information requests! They’ll be too busy trying to figure out what *isn't* blacked out.

Of course, the media, what's left of it anyway, is having a field day. CNN, now exclusively broadcasting from a bunker in Canada, is reporting this as an assault on the First Amendment. Well, CNN, bless your little maple-syrup-soaked hearts, the First Amendment is now the "Second Amendment Jr." It ranks just below the right to bear arms, but above the right to bear witness.

And the economy? Booming! At least, that’s what TruthSocial is telling us. Apparently, the new TrumpCoin, backed by the full faith and credit of… well, nobody really knows, is skyrocketing. Economists are baffled. They keep using terms like "Ponzi scheme" and "inherently unstable," but frankly, those are just fancy words for "patriotic investment opportunity." I mean, who needs gold when you can have a digital token emblazoned with the President's face? It's the future! Or, at least, it's next week.

On the international front, things are equally… interesting. The Great Wall of America, now stretching from sea to shining sea (and partially submerged in both), is nearing completion. Mexico, bless their hearts, are still somehow paying for it. Don’t ask me how. Something about a trade deal involving avocados and… well, let’s just say it involves a lot of avocados.

And then there’s the Space Force. They’ve finally discovered intelligent life. It’s on Twitter. Apparently, aliens are just as obsessed with conspiracy theories and cat videos as we are. The only difference is, they have better Wi-Fi. The Space Force is currently working on a program to beam TruthSocial directly into the alien’s brains. For the sake of the galaxy, let's hope they have a good spam filter.

But the real story this week, the one that's got everyone buzzing, is the President’s new initiative to combat… “wokeness.” He’s declared a national emergency, citing the “existential threat” posed by… pronouns. Yes, pronouns. Apparently, they’re the root of all evil. From inflation to climate change to the designated hitter rule, it's all the fault of those pesky pronouns.

The solution? Mandatory re-education camps where citizens will be forced to conjugate verbs in the traditional masculine/feminine binary. Non-binary individuals will be given a choice: conform or… well, let's just say the alternative involves a lot of awkward grammar lessons.

The irony, of course, is that the President himself struggles with pronouns. He still refers to himself in the third person, often confusing “he” with “the greatest president in the history of the universe.” But hey, who are we to judge? Grammar is for losers. Real patriots communicate through sheer force of will and strategically placed exclamation points!

And finally, a brief update on the ongoing investigation into… well, everything. The Special Prosecutor, Rudy Giuliani (again, he’s still technically a lawyer, somehow), has announced that he’s close to cracking the case. He
