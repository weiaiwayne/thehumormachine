Alright, alright, settle down folks. Welcome back to “Truthiness: Still Technically Legal.” It’s great to be here. Mostly. You know, for a show broadcasting from… *checks notes* … a decommissioned Chuck E. Cheese in Tijuana. Turns out, “Free Speech Zones” have a different definition these days. More like “Free Speech, *Si usted tiene visa.*”

Speaking of visas, anyone seen Melania lately? Just asking for a friend. A very, *very* powerful friend. Who’s also… apparently a collector of vintage garden gnomes. Don't ask.

But let's get real, shall we? The year is 2025. And if you're not feeling a profound sense of existential dread, you're either blissfully ignorant or, more likely, you're on the Supreme Court.

Remember back in 2020 when we all thought things couldn't get any weirder? Ah, youth. So naive. So... pre-mandatory re-education camps for anyone caught quoting Hamilton.

(Takes a long swig of water.)

Anyway, the Big Man’s back. And this time, he’s not playing. He's *literally* not playing. Apparently, golf is now considered a “gateway activity” to… *checks notes again* … “critical race theory appreciation.” So, no more tee times. Just mandatory viewings of “Celebrity Apprentice” on a loop. For national security reasons, of course.

And the cabinet? Oh, honey, the cabinet. It’s like a parody of a parody. The Secretary of Education is a parrot trained to recite excerpts from “Art of the Deal.” The Secretary of Energy believes windmills cause autism. And the Secretary of Transportation? Well, let's just say Elon Musk is now in charge of all public transport and the only option is a self-driving Cybertruck painted gold. Good luck parallel parking in Manhattan.

But hey, at least gas prices are down! Mostly because nobody can afford to drive anywhere anymore. The economy is booming! For arms dealers and purveyors of luxury bunkers. Everyone else is just… thriving in the resilience economy. You know, bartering for lentils and homemade kombucha. It's very artisanal. Very… post-apocalyptic chic.

And the news? The *real* news? That's all on Substack, baby. Run by exiled journalists from… well, everywhere. It's like the French Resistance, but with better Wi-Fi and more cat memes.

(Pauses, looks directly into the camera.)

You know, they say history repeats itself. But this time, it feels less like a repeat and more like a remix. A really bad remix. Like Skrillex doing a polka.

Remember the good old days when we were worried about fake news? Now, we’re worried about *real* news. Because the government is making it illegal. It's a whole new level of irony. It's like Orwell wrote a sitcom, and the laugh track is provided by state-sponsored bots.

Speaking of bots, apparently, the entire online commentariat is now just AI. Which explains a lot, honestly. All those arguments about pineapple on pizza? Generated by algorithms designed to create maximum societal discord. Makes you think, doesn’t it? About the true meaning of… digital existentialism. Or maybe I just need a stronger drink.

(Gestures to the water bottle.)

Don't worry, this is totally water. I swear. It's just… infused with electrolytes. And a healthy dose of paranoia.

But hey, at least we have entertainment! The new season of "The Real Housewives of Mar-a-Lago Retirement Home" is supposed to be *amazing*. Apparently, Ivanka and Tiffany are feuding over who gets to inherit the golden toilet. Riveting stuff. Truly. It's the kind of drama that makes you forget about the impending climate apocalypse.

And speaking of climate change, remember when that was a big deal? Now, it's just… Tuesday. The polar bears have all moved to Canada. They're starting a hockey team. It's actually quite heartwarming. In a tragically ironic sort of way.

(Leans into the microphone conspiratorially.)

You know, I heard a rumor that the government is planning to rename the Earth. Something catchier. Something more… on brand. I'm thinking "Trump World: Now With More Deserts." Or maybe "MAGA-terra." I don't know. I'm just spitballing here.

But seriously, folks, what's a comedian to
