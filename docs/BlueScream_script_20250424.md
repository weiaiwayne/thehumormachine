**(Opening sequence: A montage of increasingly absurd news clips plays, culminating in a shot of Donald Trump golfing with a bald eagle perched precariously on his shoulder.)**

**(BlueScream walks out to thunderous applause, a slightly weary but still defiant glint in his eye. He adjusts his tie, which is, as always, a slightly askew shade of electric blue.)**

**BlueScream:** Well, folks, good evening. Or, as I like to call it these days, "Tuesday." Because, let’s be honest, every day feels like the punchline to a joke we didn't even tell.

**(Slight pause for laughter, then a pointed stare at the camera.)**

So, here we are. 2025. The future we were promised involved flying cars, universal basic income, and personalized jetpacks. What we got was...well, let’s just say the only thing flying these days is the national debt. And the only thing universal is the feeling that we're all slowly losing our minds.

**(He gestures to a screen behind him showing a headline: "Trump Announces New Space Force Initiative: 'Building a Wall Around Mars!'")**

Speaking of space, President Trump, bless his perpetually tanned heart, has announced his latest initiative for the Space Force. He's building a wall...around Mars. Yes, you heard that right. Apparently, the illegal alien problem has gone interplanetary. I guess the little green men are taking jobs away from hardworking American robots. And who's going to pay for it? According to Trump, "The Martians. They've got resources up there. Bigly resources. Believe me."

**(BlueScream raises an eyebrow, deadpan.)**

I'm not sure what's more terrifying: the idea of a Martian deportation force, or the fact that this actually sounds plausible coming from the White House. I mean, at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he announced a plan to tax the rings of Saturn. “They’re just circling up there, not contributing to the economy! Very unfair!”

**(He clicks a remote and the screen changes to a picture of a politician awkwardly holding a baby.)**

And then there’s Congressman Bob “Patriot” Peterson, who recently introduced a bill to ban all books that contain "un-American" ideas. When asked to define "un-American," he replied, "Anything that makes me feel uncomfortable." So, basically, anything written after 1776. I guess the Federalist Papers are safe...for now.

**(BlueScream sighs dramatically.)**

It's truly inspiring to see our elected officials working so hard to protect us from the dangers of…thinking. Because, you know, ignorance is bliss. And apparently, bliss is a key component of a strong national defense. Who knew?

**(The screen changes to a graphic showing a graph with a steep upward trajectory labeled "National Anxiety Levels.")**

And speaking of anxiety, let’s talk about the economy. Remember that "trickle-down" economics we were promised? Well, it turns out the only thing trickling down is sweat. From the brows of people working three jobs to make ends meet. The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is slowly being squeezed into a tube of toothpaste. I’m not even sure what flavor anymore. It’s probably “Despair Mint.”

**(He takes a sip of water, then grimaces.)**

You know, sometimes I wonder if we're living in a simulation. Because how else do you explain the sheer level of absurdity we’re experiencing? It’s like someone cranked the difficulty level up to "apocalypse" and forgot to give us the cheat codes.

**(The screen shows a photo of a group of people protesting with signs that read "Keep Space Force Out of My Backyard!" and "No Wall on Mars!")**

But, hey, at least people are protesting. That's something, right? Although, I did see one protest sign that read, "I Can't Believe I Still Have to Protest This Sh*t." And honestly, that pretty much sums up the national mood.

**(BlueScream leans into the microphone, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.)**

Here’s the thing, folks. I’m not going to lie. Things are… challenging. But we can’t afford to give up. We can’t afford to become cynical. Because cynicism is just apathy wearing a trench coat. And apathy is the enemy.

**(He straightens up, his voice regaining its usual bite.)**

We need to keep laughing. We need to keep questioning. We need to keep holding these clowns accountable. Even if it feels like we’re shouting into the void. Because maybe, just maybe, someone out there is listening. Or at least, someone
