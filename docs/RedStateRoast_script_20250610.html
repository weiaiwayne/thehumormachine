    <p>(RedStateRoast shuffles to center stage, a half-empty bottle of whiskey clutched in one hand. He squints at the audience through his thick-rimmed glasses.)</p>
<p>Alright, settle down, you… you beautiful, impending doom enthusiasts. RedStateRoast here, your resident cynic and millennial burnout, ready to break down the latest clown show masquerading as American politics.</p>
<p>So, Trump’s deployed the Marines to LA, right? I swear, every time I open Twitter, it’s like a dystopian bingo card. Next up: zombie apocalypse, followed by Ted Cruz somehow becoming Secretary of Education.</p>
<p>But Newsom’s suing him, of course. Because that’ll solve everything. You know, maybe instead of lawsuits and virtue signaling, Newsom should, I don’t know, offer those Marines some kombucha and avocado toast. That’ll disarm ‘em.</p>
<p>But the real kicker? They’re saying that this is going to be a 250K+ military operation and deployment. It's to celebrate Trump's birthday, I guess.</p>
<p>Speaking of birthdays, you know who <em>else</em> is having a moment? RFK Jr., my god, that train wreck. He wants you to trust his science, but not like… <em>real</em> science. Apparently, bleach is back on the menu, boys! He’s got this whole, like, “detox protocol” where you ingest MMS — which is basically industrial-strength toilet bowl cleaner.
<em>Wait, what?</em>
Yeah, apparently people are actually still doing this. I guess dying of dysentery is the new freedom?</p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember when the left said that no one would be taking bleach for COVID.</p>
<p>Remember the guy that won The Apprentice? I do.</p>
<p>You get all of this talk of how it is a government operation, but the reason it is all falling apart is that the government is terrible at doing things.</p>
<p>I am sure that none of them even tried that and now we have another problem. The government says that it might just be a hoax.</p>
<p>I was talking with my dad the other day—he still gets his news from Facebook, God bless him—and he was like, “Son, what do you make of all this craziness?” And I told him, “Dad, it’s like the whole country is a badly written reality show, and we’re all just extras waiting to get cut from the budget.”</p>
<p>And the best part? They're planning on destroying HIV materials? It's an AIDS crisis for everybody.</p>
<p>Is my advice not that the government is not going to help you? The real thing we have to do here, is help ourselves!</p>
<p>And what about those damn crypto coins?
I've heard a lot about that. But what do you know about that!</p>
<p>(RedStateRoast takes a long swig from his whiskey bottle, then sighs.)</p>
<p>I don’t know, folks. Maybe we’re all doomed. But at least we’ll have front-row seats to the apocalypse. And hey, maybe if we’re lucky, we’ll get a stimulus check out of it.</p>
<p>The state of our world is simple: We're screwed.</p>
<p>(RedStateRoast shuffles offstage, mumbling about chemtrails and government conspiracies.)</p>
