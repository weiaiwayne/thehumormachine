    <p>(BlueScream, cynical millennial, nursing a White Claw at the edge of the stage, with a thousand-yard stare)</p>
<p>So, okay, you guys seeing this thing with Trump and the Epstein files? I mean, seriously, is there <em>anything</em> more 2025 than a billionaire pedophile conspiracy? Like, I’m half-expecting the apocalypse to be sponsored by Manscaped.</p>
<p>And listen to this thing I read, that Trump said that he was gonna run the whole thing by saying that he thought was what's gonna happen with the new guys!</p>
<p>But okay, real talk for a second, the right can’t stop telling us, and there is nothing that will have them stop saying that they are for the families and all those things. Right? </p>
<p>(Sighs, takes a long sip of White Claw)</p>
<p>It reminds me of all the times I get in my car and what those songs are for. We gotta do better, but it just is never gonna go through my head.</p>
<p>It’s just… frustrating. I mean, what’s the point of even trying to understand this stuff anymore? It’s like trying to assemble IKEA furniture using only interpretive dance. You might <em>think</em> you’re making progress, but in the end, you’re just left with a pile of particleboard and a deep sense of existential dread.</p>
<p>(Beat)</p>
<p>You know what is even gonna happen? I know that there are gonna be people that you just don’t care for and then everyone is gonna tell you all about that. But I don’t! It is what happened!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there is no point. It's all about the clicks, and the stuff, so that all that doesn't have to be seen!</p>
<p>And because there is the stuff that I can't think.</p>
<p>Is there some place else? All there is is to sell and get all our money out of our bank accounts!</p>
<p>(Beat, sips White Claw)</p>
<p>You know, some people are saying it’s a sign of the apocalypse. But honestly, I think it’s just… Tuesday. I mean, it will end when you just are done with putting up with it. So, maybe think about that and have those nice thoughts. That’s all you need to know.</p>
<p>I need another claw. The world is a joke if this isn’t true.</p>
<p>(BlueScream stumbles offstage, muttering about the Illuminati and the coming of sentient sourdough bread)</p>
