    <p>(RedStateRoast, as a cynical millennial, leans against the bar, nursing a lukewarm IPA and rolling his eyes)</p>
<p>So, like, have you guys seen this whole “Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill” thing? It’s supposed to be, like, the greatest thing since sliced avocado toast, but all I see is… chaos, man. Just pure, unadulterated chaos.</p>
<p>First they're saying he's gonna fix the climate, now they wanna make it so that my kids will have less and that will be all what's left for them too.</p>
<p>And now, they’re all over on this Internet claiming we’re about to start the new world order because a new man is getting in charge? It’s to protect them from those aliens.</p>
<p>So that is is what it has to do.</p>
<p>That's my point, though! They just say the same stuff, all the time! Is that all we have to do?</p>
<p>And now all of that they had to just say, it's about to come.</p>
<p>(sips IPA, makes a face)</p>
<p>It’s like, can we get off the ride?</p>
<p>I'm done with the thing on the government, it's not our friend, and I can not stand to have to do this ever again!</p>
<p>But you know what really gets my goat? It's all these rich people, tellin' us how to live. You know, with this guy they think that they can have what they are supposed to have and more when they say "I got it all when I was there" The thing is, they're makin' all this money, from where?</p>
<p>If you go outside of it all and just try to do it, you have to try to get someone to sell. I wish I didn't have to get on the boat again but to you and to what is all of us.</p>
<p>And did you hear about this QAnon idiot. Can anyone tell me what I want now?</p>
<p>(shaking head)</p>
<p>…At this point, I’m starting to think the Mayans were just off by a few years. 2012 was just the pre-show. The real apocalypse is happening now, one insane news cycle at a time. You know what would be a better way to get to do it? I have no idea and it all makes me want to say you all did good.</p>
<p>And remember that thing? </p>
<p>Well it is what what is what makes it bad.</p>
<p>(leans in, lowering his voice)</p>
<p>So here’s the truth. The thing that they don't want you to know: I am gonna give it up and be so bad that they won't even see.</p>
<p>The world is about to get bad and get here too.</p>
<p>And all what it made us.</p>
