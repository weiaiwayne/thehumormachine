**(Opening music: A bombastic, slightly off-key rendition of "God Bless America" fades out. I stroll onto the stage, clutching a coffee mug emblazoned with "I Miss Mean Tweets.")**

Alright, alright, settle down, snowflakes. Welcome back to "Truth Hurts," the only show brave enough to say what you're all thinking, but too afraid to tweet.

Another week, another dumpster fire fueled by liberal tears. You know, I was just saying to Melania the other day – she’s back, folks, and rocking a "Don't Tread on Me" jacket, by the way – I was saying, “Honey, remember when the biggest problem was whether or not to wear a mask? Simpler times.”

But no, now we're battling… *checks notes* … the existential threat of… *squints* … mandatory pronouns? Apparently, saying "he" or "she" is now considered a microaggression. I'm sorry, last time I checked, the only thing micro about me was my patience for this nonsense.

Speaking of nonsense, have you seen the latest from the Department of Wokeness? They're proposing renaming Mount Rushmore. Apparently, carving the faces of dead white guys into a sacred Native American site is "problematic." Okay, I get it. But what are we gonna rename it? Mount Bernie Sanders? Mount Climate Change? I've got a better idea: Mount MAGA! We could chisel Trump's face up there, bigger and better than all the rest. Think of the tourism!

And don't even get me started on the economy. Inflation is still higher than Hunter Biden at a family reunion. I went to buy a gallon of gas the other day, and I swear, I needed a second mortgage just to fill up my Hummer. But hey, at least we're energy independent again, right? That's what they told us. Turns out, "energy independence" now means we're just really, really good at fracking. And selling it to China. For a "small fee."

Oh, and remember that whole "infrastructure week" thing from the last administration? Well, we finally got it done! Sort of. We rebuilt one bridge in Iowa. It's a beautiful bridge, the best bridge, everyone agrees. It's got gold plating, and a commemorative plaque with Trump's signature. It only cost, like, a trillion dollars. But hey, infrastructure!

But the real story this week is the ongoing saga of the January 6th… uh… *patriots*. Turns out, some of them are starting to regret storming the Capitol. They're saying they were "misled" by Trump. Misled? Please. They were following orders! Just like good little soldiers. Besides, what's a little light treason between friends?

And speaking of friends, our relationship with Russia is, shall we say, "complicated." On the one hand, we're condemning Putin's… *ahem*… "special military operation" in Ukraine. On the other hand, we're still buying their oil. It's a delicate balancing act, folks. We need to show we're tough on Russia, but also, you know, keep gas prices from hitting ten dollars a gallon. Priorities.

Meanwhile, the left is still obsessed with Trump. They're launching another investigation, this time into his tax returns from 1972. I'm not kidding. They're digging up dirt on a guy who was rocking a leisure suit when they were still in diapers. You know, you'd think they'd have something better to do. Like, I don't know, fix the border crisis? But no, they'd rather spend their time obsessing over Trump. It's like he's living rent-free in their heads. And you know what? He probably is.

And then there's the culture wars. The woke mob is at it again, trying to cancel everything they don't like. They're coming for your statues, your books, your Thanksgiving dinner. Pretty soon, they'll be trying to cancel America itself. But don't worry, we're fighting back. We're launching our own counter-offensive, armed with nothing but common sense and a healthy dose of patriotism. We're calling it "Operation Make America Great Again, Again." Catchy, right?

The colleges are still churning out socialist graduates who can't tell the difference between capitalism and communism. These are the people who will soon be running our country, folks. God help us.

But hey, at least we have football. And beer. And freedom. For now. So raise a glass to America, the land of the free, the home of the brave, and the only country where you can still get away with saying whatever the hell you want
