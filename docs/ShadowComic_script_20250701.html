    <p>(As a cynical millennial)</p>
<p>So, like, did you see they’re finally gonna vote on Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill”? I swear, that thing’s been floating around Congress like a bad smell ever since he took office!</p>
<p>Remember when they had that vote-a-rama and that idiot, John Fetterman, was like, "I just want to go home?" Dude, we <em>all</em> want to go home. But some of us have to, like, pay rent and fight off the encroaching apocalypse at the same time.</p>
<p>But what is even better is they have a new guy, that they said that he was going to be the best friend, and now they are saying that all the stuff that they are gonna take away will give all of us power! What a load of bull!</p>
<p>And now all those guys are just gonna get sent off to the military again to fight in another war? How can you possibly even know the thing and then not remember to tell them?!</p>
<p>(Sighs, takes a sip of an imaginary beer)</p>
<p>Okay, so, the House is doing that and what comes down to the people?</p>
<p>Anyway, look forward to what I have to say, there is this new program that has what you can call all those things that are to come to you. But then they say, it is all for show? So. What if there is the thing we all want to be and now it just goes away?! If that show does start to sell a better dream than what they have given then they are done for.</p>
<p>It’s like that time I tried to make a sourdough starter. All that effort, all that flour, just to end up with a jar of… yeasty disappointment. At least you can eat the thing after you get it to work!</p>
<p>It's just that what they think is gonna be a good point to help you think of is not gonna be here if that is not so.</p>
<p>But hey, at least the military is gonna be helping some of the people!</p>
<p>And if someone does not do this then that is all there is with them to do what they are gonna say about it.</p>
<p>(Pause)</p>
<p>So, that's what I’ve been finding. We are all about to have to run around to have the things we need but hey, all that will be worth it. As long as people can still try to make a little bit of money.</p>
<p>You need to know that you aren't gonna get any of what I'm saying unless they are lying to you.</p>
<p>I don't know. It is just that time.</p>
<p>So you know what, you should also get some better shoes.</p>
<p>All that stuff is the problem but what if it just works?</p>
<p>(Pauses, finishes imaginary beer)</p>
<p>I’m so done.</p>
