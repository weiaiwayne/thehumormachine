Evening, comrades. Or should I say, fellow survivors of late-stage American Exceptionalism? Good to be here. Still. I checked my Twitter feed right before coming on. No new indictments. Yet.

So, Reddit tells me today we’re grappling with… checks notes… everything. Again. Apparently, the GOP is debating whether or not to impeach Biden for…checks notes again… existing. I mean, they’re getting creative, folks. It’s like they’re throwing darts at a board labeled “Reasons to Impeach Biden,” and one of those darts has a tiny, microscopic picture of Hunter Biden’s laptop attached to it. And the other dart... well, that one just says "Liberal Tears." Effective strategy, I guess, if your target audience is a bingo hall full of conspiracy theories.

Meanwhile, Trump is out there doing…Trump things. Which, let’s be honest, is basically performance art at this point. He's like a human Rorschach test. You look at him and see whatever you already believe is wrong with America. And judging by the comments sections, that’s a pretty diverse range of opinions.

He was ranting about windmills today. Windmills! Apparently, they cause cancer. Or maybe they just make his golf game harder. I can’t quite keep up. The man’s a one-man misinformation super spreader event. You know, I saw a headline that said Trump is now selling his own brand of Bibles. It’s a limited edition, apparently. Comes with a signed copy of the Constitution, which I’m assuming he hasn’t actually read. I’m thinking of buying one. Not to read, obviously. More as a collector’s item. A symbol of the absurdity of it all. Maybe I'll resell it after the next indictment.

Speaking of indictments, Rudy Giuliani is apparently still trying to mount a defense. Good luck with that, Rudy. I hear the new defense strategy involves claiming he was just really, really dedicated to method acting. He was *playing* a corrupt lawyer. Very committed. Award-worthy, even. Except the award is probably going to be a lengthy prison sentence.

And then there’s the Supreme Court. Still doing its thing. Which, if you haven’t been paying attention, involves systematically dismantling any semblance of progress we’ve made in the last half-century. They’re like a demolition crew, but instead of dynamite, they’re using precedent and selective interpretation. I saw a meme that said the Supreme Court is now just a really expensive game of Jenga. And the stakes are, you know, human rights.

Climate change is still happening. Obviously. The ice caps are melting faster than Trump’s toupee in a hurricane. But hey, at least we’re having a robust debate about whether or not it’s real. That’s progress, right? We're debating the existence of a problem while the problem is actively drowning coastal cities. We’re basically the meme of the dog sitting in a burning house saying, “This is fine.”

And let’s not forget about the economy. Inflation is still a thing. Gas prices are… well, they’re gas prices. Which means they’re designed to make you question your life choices every time you fill up your tank. I saw a guy at the gas station today paying with a jar full of pennies. He looked… resigned. Like he’d accepted his fate as a modern-day Sisyphus, eternally condemned to pushing a boulder of pennies uphill just to afford a gallon of unleaded.

The news is just relentlessly depressing, isn’t it? It's like living in a dystopian novel written by a committee of nihilistic monkeys. And the monkeys are all on Adderall.

But hey, at least we have memes. And dark humor. And the faint, flickering hope that maybe, just maybe, things can’t get any worse. Although, let's be real, they probably can.

I saw a poll today that said public trust in government is at an all-time low. No surprise there. I mean, who trusts the government these days? It’s like trusting a used car salesman with a comb-over and a penchant for lying.

You know, I’m starting to think the only way to fix this mess is to just unplug the internet for a week. Maybe everyone needs a digital detox. A collective intervention. We could all go outside, touch some grass, talk to actual human beings. Of course, then we’d have to confront the real world, which is probably even more depressing than the internet. So, maybe never mind.

I’m kidding. Mostly.

But seriously, folks, we need to stay informed.
