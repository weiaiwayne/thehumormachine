Alright, alright, settle down, you beautiful collection of tax audits waiting to happen. I see some new faces. Welcome to the resistance…or, as it’s now officially called, the “Patriotic Compliance Initiative.” We’re all patriots here, right? I mean, who *doesn’t* love paying double for gas and having their internet history scrutinized for seditious memes?

Just got off Reddit. God, what a dumpster fire…a *patriotic* dumpster fire, of course. Apparently, today’s outrage du jour is the unveiling of the new Supreme Court Justice action figures. Each one comes with a tiny gavel and a miniature dissenting opinion you can shred yourself! Collect them all and create your own dystopian legal drama…starring YOU as the powerless plebian! They even have a limited-edition “Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hologram” that can be projected onto your ceiling to remind you of what we lost. Authenticity guaranteed…or your money back in digital credits, redeemable only at approved “Freedom Fuel” stations.

Speaking of the Supreme Court, remember that whole “separation of church and state” thing? Quaint, wasn't it? Like dial-up internet or affordable healthcare. Now, every session begins with a mandatory prayer, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance…to the Supreme Court. Apparently, they're higher than God now. Which, let’s be honest, explains a lot.

And the economy! Booming, they say. Booming for whom? The guys who own the companies that make the Supreme Court action figures? My local grocery store now accepts payment in cryptocurrency, gold bullion, and…get this…good intentions. Apparently, my landlord doesn’t share the same faith in my good intentions. He prefers hard currency…or, you know, Supreme Court Justice action figures. He's got a whole collection. Claims it’s an investment. I think he’s just lonely.

Remember when we used to worry about artificial intelligence taking over the world? Turns out, we didn’t need sentient robots. We just needed politicians who could mimic them perfectly. The President, bless his heart – and I *mean* bless his heart, because he’s probably listening – unveiled his new infrastructure plan today. It involves building a giant wall…around the United States. Apparently, he’s tired of the world looking in and laughing. He wants them to pay for the wall, too. Good luck with that, buddy. I tried getting my neighbor to pay for half the fence between our yards. Ended up in small claims court…which, coincidentally, was presided over by a Supreme Court Justice action figure enthusiast.

And the news media! Oh, the news media. Always so fair and balanced…especially now that there’s only one news channel. It’s called “The Truth Network,” and it broadcasts 24/7 directly from the President’s Twitter feed. They even have a special segment dedicated to debunking “fake news”…which is anything that doesn’t agree with the President’s Twitter feed. They showed a picture of me on the screen earlier today. Said I was a “threat to national security.” I think it was the rumpled suit.

They’re also cracking down on “unpatriotic” entertainment. Apparently, satire is now considered a form of treason. Who knew? I thought it was a form of paying the bills. My agent called me today. Said I need to “tone it down” and “focus on family-friendly content.” He suggested I write a sitcom about a family of squirrels who learn the importance of…wait for it…paying their taxes. I told him to shove it. I mean, squirrels don’t even *have* pockets. Where would they keep the receipts?

And social media! They finally found a way to make it even more toxic. Every post is now rated on a “Patriotism Index.” The higher your score, the more privileges you get. Like faster internet speeds…and the ability to buy Supreme Court Justice action figures before everyone else. I’m currently hovering somewhere between “Seditious Hamster” and “Enemy of the People.” It’s not great for my dating life.

Remember when conspiracy theories were fringe? Now they’re mainstream. Everyone believes something crazy. My Uber driver told me today that the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the President is secretly a lizard person. I just gave him a five-star rating and prayed he wouldn’t drive me off a cliff.

But hey, at least we have freedom, right? Freedom to…well, freedom to…think about freedom. And to buy Supreme Court Justice action figures
