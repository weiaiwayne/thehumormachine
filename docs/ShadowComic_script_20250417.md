**(Opening scene: ShadowComic strides onto a minimalist stage, bathed in a single, stark spotlight. He's wearing a subtly rumpled suit, a deliberate contrast to the perfectly coiffed news anchors flickering on a screen behind him. He raises an eyebrow, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips.)**

ShadowComic: Good evening, patriots. Or as the Department of Re-Education prefers to call you now, "Compliance Units." Welcome to "Truthiness, Rebranded," the only show brave enough to tell you what the *official* truth is.

(He gestures vaguely towards the screen, which now displays a digitally enhanced image of President Trump, looking unnervingly svelte and sporting a halo.)

ShadowComic: Yes, folks, he's back. Twice as tanned, half the attention span. They say lightning doesn't strike twice, but apparently, electoral dysfunction does. And this time, it brought a friend: the Department of Cognitive Re-Alignment. Their motto? "Making America Think Again… The Way We Tell You To."

(He pauses for a beat, letting the silence hang in the air.)

ShadowComic: Remember when we used to argue about tax cuts? Simpler times. Now we argue about whether gravity is a liberal hoax propagated by Deep State Newton. The official answer, by the way, is that gravity is "under review." Apparently, the President found it personally offensive when his golf ball landed in a bunker.

(He takes a sip from a glass of water, his eyes never leaving the audience.)

ShadowComic: And speaking of bunkers, the new White House is entirely subterranean. Apparently, the President's advisors convinced him that the sun is a socialist plot to redistribute vitamin D. The upside? No more embarrassing Rose Garden press conferences. The downside? We're one bad earthquake away from a sequel to "Dr. Strangelove."

(He throws a playful jab at the audience)

ShadowComic: Don't worry, I'm sure we'll all be safe. The Department of Homeland Security assures us that the new underground complex is entirely impervious to "un-American" phenomena like earthquakes and… facts.

(He shifts gears slightly.)

ShadowComic: But it’s not all doom and gloom, folks. There are some bright spots. For instance, the national debt is now officially "imaginary." The Treasury Department has simply declared it a "liberal hallucination," and anyone who disagrees is invited to a complimentary re-education seminar. I hear they serve surprisingly good chamomile tea.

(He feigns a shudder.)

ShadowComic: And remember climate change? Gone! Poof! Vanished faster than funding for public education. The Environmental Protection Agency has been replaced by the Department of Optimistic Weather Forecasts. Their latest report predicts a 100% chance of sunshine and prosperity… indefinitely. Any discrepancies you may notice are attributed to "alternative atmospheric narratives."

(He leans into the microphone, lowering his voice conspiratorially.)

ShadowComic: Of course, some naysayers, those relics of the pre-enlightenment era, still cling to their "data" and "science." But the President has a solution for them: the National Institute for Factual Revision. They're currently working on a comprehensive rewrite of history, starting with the inconvenient truth that he lost the 2020 election. The working title? "The Great American Victory: A Narrative of Uninterrupted Triumph."

(He straightens up, his tone becoming more cutting.)

ShadowComic: Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is busier than ever. They're currently hearing arguments on whether corporations have the right to vote, and whether the First Amendment protects the right to bear arms… *against* the government. Early indications suggest a favorable ruling on both counts. After all, who needs democracy when you have quarterly earnings reports?

(He lets out a dry chuckle.)

ShadowComic: But let's not forget the arts! The new Secretary of Culture has declared that all art must be "patriotic, uplifting, and devoid of subversive messaging." Which means we can look forward to a deluge of paintings depicting the President as a benevolent demigod, single-handedly wrestling alligators and solving world hunger. I’m particularly excited for the interpretive dance version of the Mueller Report.

(He glances at his watch, a knowing glint in his eye.)

ShadowComic: And that’s all the official truth we have time for tonight, folks. Remember, doubt is un-American. Critical thinking is a sign of insufficient patriotism. And independent thought is a gateway drug to… well, we don't talk about that.

(He smiles, a genuine, almost defiant smile.)

ShadowComic: Stay vigilant. Stay compliant. And above all, stay… uninformed. It’s safer that way.

(He bows slightly as the spotlight fades, leaving the audience in darkness. The screen behind him flickers
