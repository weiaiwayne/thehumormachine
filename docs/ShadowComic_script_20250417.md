Good evening, patriots. Or, as we’re now legally obligated to call you, ‘Consumers of American-Made Thought Products.’ Welcome back to… well, we’re not entirely sure what we’re calling this show anymore. The lawyers are still debating whether ‘Truth Adjacent’ is seditious. I’m ShadowComic, and I’m still here. Apparently, they haven’t found a suitable replacement yet. Or maybe they’re just enjoying the spectacle of my slow, agonizing descent into irrelevance. Either way, thanks for tuning in.

So, another week in the glorious Second Trump Administration. It's like déjà vu, but this time the coffee tastes vaguely of desperation and burnt hair. Remember when we thought four years of that was the apocalypse? Turns out, that was just the trailer. This is the extended director's cut, now with extra authoritarianism and a free MAGA hat with every forced labor camp assignment.

Speaking of hats, did you see the President’s latest press conference? Magnificent. He unveiled the new national bird. No, not the bald eagle. Turns out, they're "too woke." Apparently, their baldness is a subtle commentary on the President's own hairline. The new national bird is the peacock. Because, as the President eloquently put it, "They're beautiful. They're vain. And they strut around like they own the place. Just like me!" The avian symbolism is… breathtaking.

And the Supreme Court? Oh, the Supreme Court is doing just fine. They're currently debating the merits of mandatory national anthem karaoke before every public restroom visit. Chief Justice Kavanaugh insists it's a matter of national security. Apparently, a poorly sung "Star-Spangled Banner" is a gateway drug to… I don't know… thinking for yourself?

But the real news, the stuff that keeps me up at night, is the ongoing investigation into… wait for it… the “Deep State Squirrel Conspiracy.” Apparently, squirrels are secretly controlling the flow of acorns, thereby manipulating the world's nut-based economy. The evidence? A grainy photo of a squirrel wearing a tiny, almost imperceptible, earpiece. The lead investigator? Rudy Giuliani. Back from the dead, folks! Or at least, back from whatever dimension he was vacationing in.

The good news is, he's promised to reveal all the evidence at a press conference next week. He's booked the Four Seasons… again. But this time, he’s clarified it’s the Four Seasons Total Landscaping… in Siberia. Apparently, the cold helps his memory. Or maybe it just freezes his brain before he can say anything incriminating.

And let’s not forget about the economy. It’s booming! Well, for a select few. The rest of us are just trying to figure out how to pay for groceries with our government-issued TrumpCoin. It’s a digital currency backed by… well, nobody’s quite sure. It’s either gold, the President’s ego, or the tears of liberals. Probably all three.

The official unemployment rate is zero! How? Simple. Everyone is now employed as a “Patriotism Compliance Officer.” Their job? To ensure everyone is adhering to the new national guidelines. Which, by the way, are updated daily via TikTok. And, in case you're wondering, yes, TikTok is now owned by the Trump Organization. They're calling it "TruthTok." It's where you go to get your daily dose of… truth. Conveniently filtered, of course.

And speaking of truth, the Department of Education has released a new history textbook. It’s called "America: The Absolutely Amazing Story (According to Me)." It’s 800 pages of pure, unadulterated… historical fiction. Apparently, Abraham Lincoln was a Democrat. And the Civil War was fought over… tariffs.

But hey, at least we have free speech, right? Well, sort of. You can say whatever you want, as long as it aligns with the official narrative. Dissent is… discouraged. And by discouraged, I mean punishable by re-education. Re-education, of course, involves watching endless loops of the President’s rallies. It’s surprisingly effective.

The one bright spot? The resistance. It’s small, it’s scattered, and it’s mostly comprised of librarians and disillusioned AI programmers. But they’re out there. They’re whispering the truth in the digital shadows. They’re… well, they’re probably being monitored by the NSA. But at least they’re trying.

I’m trying too. Every night, I come out here, under this spotlight,
