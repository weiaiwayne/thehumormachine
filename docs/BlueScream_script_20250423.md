**BlueScream:** Welcome back, folks. Welcome back to the only show where we fact-check politicians with a rubber chicken and a healthy dose of existential dread.

So, here we are. 2025. Trump's back. Again. It's like that rash you thought you got rid of in college – only this time, it's running the free world. And by "free world," I mean the world that’s still trying to figure out how to pay for healthcare while simultaneously funding Jeff Bezos' space retirement plan.

I’ve been catching up on Reddit, you know, conducting cutting-edge journalistic research, and let me tell you, the pulse of the nation is… concerning. Apparently, the hot new trend is trading bottle caps for gasoline. I mean, Mad Max was supposed to be a *warning*, people, not a lifestyle blog!

But hey, at least we're innovative. Under this administration, America is leading the world in… well, in something. I think it’s the number of lawsuits filed against the President. We’re definitely number one in that. It’s a thriving industry, really. Legal firms are practically handing out commemorative "I Sued the President and All I Got Was This T-Shirt… And a Restraining Order" merchandise.

Speaking of innovation, remember that whole "infrastructure week" thing from the last Trump administration? Well, they’re trying it again. This time, it’s “Infrastructu-Rave Week.” The plan is to fix the nation's bridges and roads using only glow sticks, EDM, and the collective energy of disappointed millennials. I’m told the first bridge to be “renovated” collapsed spectacularly during the bass drop. But hey, at least it was a *memorable* collapse.

And then there's the economy. Apparently, the new economic strategy is based on... well, I’m not entirely sure. It seems to involve a lot of tweets, tariffs on everything except Ivanka’s handbags, and a vague promise to bring back coal mining to… Silicon Valley. I’m not an economist, but I’m pretty sure that’s like trying to fix a leaky faucet with a ham sandwich. You *might* stop the leak, but you’ll probably attract ants. And now you have a ham sandwich problem.

The administration also announced a bold new initiative to combat climate change. And I quote, "Climate change is fake news! But just in case, we're building a giant umbrella over Mar-a-Lago." Apparently, the science is still out on whether this will actually work, but the President assures us it will be "tremendous, the best umbrella, everyone agrees." I’m told the umbrella is being constructed entirely out of non-recyclable plastic. Because, you know, irony.

And let's not forget about foreign policy. Relations with China are currently being managed through a series of competitive TikTok dances. I’m not kidding. The Secretary of State challenged the Chinese Foreign Minister to a dance-off, judged by a panel of Gen Z influencers. Apparently, America lost. Badly. Rumor has it, the Secretary of State tried to incorporate the Macarena into his routine. It did not go well.

Meanwhile, relations with Russia are... well, they're complicated. It's like that couple you know who are constantly fighting but somehow still end up at the same karaoke bar every Friday night. Everyone’s pretending they don’t see it, but you can cut the tension with a rusty butter knife.

But hey, it's not all doom and gloom. On the bright side, the price of popcorn has gone down. Apparently, everyone is too stressed to eat it. So, that’s… something.

And speaking of stress, the Surgeon General has issued a nationwide advisory urging Americans to "take a deep breath… or several… or maybe just move to Canada." He also recommended limiting exposure to news, social media, and the President's Twitter feed. Which, let’s be honest, is probably the best medical advice anyone has given in the last four years.

But you know what really gets me? The sheer *banality* of it all. We’ve reached a point where the absurd is the new normal. It’s like living in a never-ending episode of *Black Mirror*, only without the insightful commentary. Just… endless scrolling through outrage and despair, punctuated by the occasional viral video of a cat playing the piano.

So, what are we supposed to do? Well, I don't have all the answers. But I do know that we can't afford to become numb. We can't afford to lose our sense of humor. And we definitely can't afford to let
