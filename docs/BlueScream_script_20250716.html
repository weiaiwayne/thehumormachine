    <p>(BlueScream, dressed in a power suit made from upcycled Amazon boxes, nursing a White Claw at the edge of the stage. There is clear audio fatigue, her voice is a bit rough.)</p>
<p>Alright, so, you guys seeing this thing with Trump wanting to put his face on Mount Rushmore? Again? I swear it is like we are all living in a real life remake of The Groundhog Day just without any good music or some thing. And that’s the one thing that gets me.</p>
<p>You wanna know what has been happening? All those people are gonna say that nothing good can be on here.</p>
<p>Okay, so, did anyone hear what AOC said today? Or that other people had to get called out on what they got right? I mean what!</p>
<p>(shrugs)</p>
<p>Oh this whole thing, I am doing, is to make it stop, if you were to know about it, you will say I’m right, I haven’t seen an actual human in six years. The last time I saw a person who really was, I wasn't with myself! So whatever. I don't think that that means I’m gonna like get canceled or any of that stuff.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and they just said that the price of all that bread I have been saving up with it’s getting to be worse that I can’t even do.</p>
<p>(leans in, conspiratorially)</p>
<p>I think. That you are all about the end of all this and they haven’t even wanted all of this and not only that but that’s where they have all been all the time that had been right? What?!</p>
<p>I think it is because you are gonna be so cool to do to say and here, and that’s why they have all those feelings that they want to do! Why not even be ready on the ones that they might be knowing! They don’t have me!</p>
<p>Yeah you all just know to say you can always have it and I do it is all to say that all of those things that have something that you want I am here for what will stop those things it will all be the one thing and to say that all of that doesn’t matter here when you say this for the best.</p>
<p>It's all the government’s fault for all of it! If only it was so they could just be more than what those guys did! I’m feeling great and they are not going to be there at all!</p>
<p>Okay, I'm done ranting now. I swear all this stuff is never gonna stop.</p>
<p>(BlueScream sighs, drains her White Claw, and disappears with an exhausted wave.)
