Good evening, patriots! Or, as the perpetually offended like to call you, "threats to democracy." It's good to be back, reminding you that sanity still exists somewhere between the organic kale smoothie and the gender studies seminar.

So, another week, another dumpster fire fueled by liberal tears. I swear, you could power a small city with the outrage they generate over Trump playing golf. Speaking of which, the President just shot a 72. Impressive! I mean, Biden still thinks a putter is something you use to stir your Metamucil.

But let’s get serious, folks. The big story this week is the unveiling of the new "Equity Enhancement Initiative," spearheaded by Vice President AOC. Apparently, "equality" wasn’t woke enough. Now we need "equity," which, as far as I can tell, means confiscating your hard-earned money and giving it to someone who identifies as "disadvantaged," even if they're driving a Tesla and have a trust fund bigger than my mortgage.

The initiative includes a "Reparations for Microaggressions" fund. I kid you not. You can now sue your neighbor for saying "Good morning!" with the wrong inflection. The legal precedent? Apparently, it caused "emotional distress" and triggered their "lived experience of systemic oppression." I’m starting to think snowflakes are actually a renewable energy source.

And don’t even get me started on the new curriculum in schools. They’ve replaced history class with "Decolonizing Gender Studies Through Interpretive Dance." My niece came home the other day and asked me if George Washington was a cis-heteronormative oppressor. I told her he was busy fighting the British, which is more than she’s done all week.

Then there's the ongoing saga of the "Climate Justice Corps," now affectionately known as the "Leaf Blower Brigade." They’re still out there, "fighting climate change" by meticulously raking leaves in Central Park. Apparently, preventing leaves from decomposing and releasing carbon dioxide is the key to saving the planet. I guess nobody told them about compost. Or, you know, actual solutions. But hey, at least they’re getting exercise. Burning calories is the real solution to climate change anyway; fewer woke lattes, less carbon footprint.

Meanwhile, the border is still about as secure as Biden’s cognitive abilities. Remember when they promised us the wall would be racist? Turns out, it’s just really good at keeping Americans out of Mexico. The cartels are thriving, fentanyl is flowing, and our leaders are busy debating whether to call them "undocumented migrants" or "people seeking a better life." I call them "trespassers." But that’s just me, a deplorable.

And speaking of deplorable, the Supreme Court just ruled that pineapple on pizza is a constitutionally protected right. I’m not sure what's worse: the fact that this even made it to the Supreme Court, or that there are people who actually *like* pineapple on pizza. I’m starting to think the apocalypse is closer than we think.

But fear not, patriots! There is a glimmer of hope. The latest polls show that Trump's approval rating is higher than Kamala Harris’s IQ. Okay, that’s not saying much, but still! People are finally waking up to the fact that "wokeness" is just another form of totalitarianism, disguised as social justice.

The left is now trying to claim that our "Let's Go Brandon" chants are a form of hate speech. Sorry, libs, but that's just a clever way of saying what everyone is already thinking. If you don't like it, maybe try earning some respect instead of demanding it.

And finally, a quick update on the culture wars. Disney announced their new live-action remake of *Snow White*. Snow White is now a gender-fluid, non-binary activist who saves the seven dwarves from toxic masculinity. The prince is a vegan who protests the exploitation of labradoodles. I’m not making this up. I swear, I need a drink.

So, there you have it, folks. Another week in the twilight zone of American politics. Remember to stay vigilant, stay informed, and for the love of all that is holy, keep your pineapple away from my pizza.
